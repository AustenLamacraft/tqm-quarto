# Theories of Quantum Matter

These are the materials for Theories of Quantum Matter, a Part III Physics course at the University of Cambridge taught in Michaelmas 2024. [tqm.tripos.org](https://tqm.tripos.org/) is the live version of the notes. 

The materials for previous versions of the course can be found [here](https://austen.uk/courses/). While these are largely unchanged, you should regard this site as the authoritative version for 2024.

The source of these notes is [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/AustenLamacraft/tqm-quarto). If you find a typo, other problem or have any other comment on the material, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/AustenLamacraft/tqm-quarto/issues) there.

## TODOs

- [X] Callouts for in-lecture problems
- [X] Add list of supervisions
- [X] Add details about supervisions
- [X] Sun Woo correction in first lecture (normalization factor)
- [X] Add $\hbar =1$ warning!!
- [X] Add advice to complete exercises
- [ ] Build problems with PDF. How to fix
- [X] Favicon for site
- [ ] FQHE animation not working
- [ ] Fix cot / tan disagreement between spin models lectures and slides
- [ ] Switch to `\Braket` in KaTeX for matrix elements / expectation values in slides
- [ ] I believe there is an inconsistency between the two parts of Q6. The wavefunction given in the second part is problematic dimensionally - |c| doesn't have dimensions of inverse length. This is because the mass of the bosons m is not involved. From my results it follows that the consistent densities are obtained for m=2, i.e. the power of the exponents in psi should be m|c|/4*|x_j-x_k|.
- [X] There may be an inconsistency in the definition of Anderson spins. North pole should be occupancy by a pair but the u_p, v_p parameterization says otherwise.

- [ ] Respond to Daniil's question about FDT symmetry for different operators 

- [ ] Add material not lectured to site

- [ ] Deal with old Atilla questions about Bethe Ansatz
