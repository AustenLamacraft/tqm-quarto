As usual \\([u_i,p_j]=i\\delta_{ij}\\). To orient ourselves, we solve the classical version of the problem.\n\n1.1 Equations of Motion\nYou’ve seen this before. The equations of motion are\n\\[\nm \\ddot u_j = k(u_{j-1} + u_{j+1} - 2u_j).\n\\]\nWe look for oscillatory solutions with time dependence \\(u_j(t) = u_j e^{-i\\omega t}\\), arriving at the matrix eigenvalue problem\n\\[\n-\\omega^2 \\begin{pmatrix}\nu_1 \\\\\nu_2 \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\nu_{N-1}\\\\\nu_N\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\frac{k}{m}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\\n1 & -2 & 1 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n0 & \\cdot & 1 & -2 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nu_1 \\\\\nu_2 \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\nu_{N-1}\\\\\nu_N\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nMatrices of this type are called circulant matrices, and arise here because of the translational invariance of the system (including the periodic boundary conditions). Their eigenvectors are given by plane waves \\(u_j = (z_n)^j\\), where \\(z_n\\) is one of the \\(N^\\text{th}\\) roots of unity i.e. \\(z^N = 1\\) or\n\\[\nz_n = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i n}{N}\\right),\\qquad n = 0,\\ldots, N-1.\n\\]\nIn fact, to make things a bit more symmetrical, let’s take \\(N\\) to be odd and index the \\(z_n\\) using both positive and negative values of \\(n\\)\n\\[\nz_n = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i n}{N}\\right),\\qquad n = -(N-1)/2,\\ldots, (N-1)/2.\n\\]\nWe’ll write \\(\\eta_n\\equiv \\frac{2\\pi n}{N}\\), so that the eigenstates have the form \\(u_j=\\exp(i\\eta_n j)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nBy substituting into the equation of motion show that the dispersion relation is \\[\n\\omega(\\eta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\eta/2\\right|.\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\nNotice that:\n\nThe frequency vanishes at \\(\\eta\\to 0\\). This mode corresponds to translation of the system, for which there is no restoring force.\nAt small \\(\\eta\\) the dispersion is linear, as we would expect for sound waves.\n\nA general motion of the system can be represented as a superposition of the normal modes \\[\nu_j(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} q_n(t) e^{i\\eta_n j},\n\\label{coll_modes}\n\\] together with the condition \\(q_{-n}=q^*_n\\) on the complex amplitudes to ensure that \\(u_j\\) is real. The amplitudes \\(q_n(t)\\) have time dependence \\[\nq_n(t) = \\alpha_n e^{-i\\omega(\\eta_n) t} + \\beta_n e^{i\\omega(\\eta_n) t}\n\\] for \\(n\\neq 0\\), while for \\(n=0\\) \\[\nq_0(t) = \\sqrt{N}(X+Vt)\n\\] describes the motion of the centre of mass.\n\n\n1.2 Hamiltonian Formulation\nTo make contact with quantum physics, let’s look at this problem from the Hamiltonian perspective. If the \\(q_n\\) are to be our canonical coordinates, then we should likewise write the momenta in terms of Fourier modes \\[\np_j(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\pi_n(t) e^{-i\\eta_n j},\n\\tag{3}\\] If \\(u_j\\), \\(p_j\\) are canonical variables with Poisson Bracket \\(\\{u_j, p_k\\}=\\delta_{jk}\\), then it follows that \\(\\{q_m,\\pi_n\\}=\\delta_{mn}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that in terms of the Fourier modes the Hamiltonian Equation 1 is \\[\nH = \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left[\\frac{1}{2m}\\pi_n \\pi_{-n} + k  (1-\\cos \\eta_n) q_n q_{-n}\\right].\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\nThis almost looks like a system of harmonic oscillators. Bear in mind that the \\(q_n\\) and \\(\\pi_n\\) are complex. One could, for example, split the amplitudes into their real and imaginary parts \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(q_n' + i q_n''\\right),\\quad q_{-n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(q_n' - i q_n''\\right)\\\\\n\\pi_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\pi_n' + i \\pi_n''\\right),\\quad \\pi_{-n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\pi_n' - i \\pi_n''\\right),\\quad n\\geq 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5}\\] The Hamiltonian would then become \\(H=H' + H''\\) with \\[\nH' = \\sum_{0 &lt; n \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left[\\frac{1}{2m}\\pi'_n \\pi'_{n} + k  (1-\\cos \\eta_n) q'_n q'_{n}\\right].\n\\] and similarly for \\(H''\\). By comparing with the standard form \\[\nH_\\text{SHO} = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2,\n\\tag{6}\\] we can read off the dispersion relation Equation 2. The decomposition Equation 5 amounts to working with the real amplitudes of sine and cosine waves. Other options are possible.\n\n\n1.3 Complex Coordinates\nSticking with the classical problem, let’s introduce complex coordinates to describe the two dimensional phase space of a single oscillator \\[\n\\begin{equation}\na = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2}}\\left(x + \\frac{i}{m\\omega} p \\right).\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{7}\\] \\(a\\) and its conjugate satisfy \\(\\{a^{},a^*\\}=-i\\). This definition is chosen so that the Hamiltonian takes the simple form \\[\nH = \\omega \\left|a\\right|^2.\n\\] Hamilton’s equations of motion are then \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot a &= \\{a, H \\} = -i\\omega a\\\\\n\\dot a^* &= \\{a^*, H \\} = i\\omega a^*.\n\\end{align}\n\\] with solution \\(a(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} a(0)\\) describing circular motion in the complex \\(a\\) plane on a contour of fixed energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nSatisfy yourself — without doing any calculations — that \\(a(t)\\) defined by Equation 7 goes clockwise in the complex plane.\n\n\nIn the same way, we can introduce the coordinates \\[\n\\begin{align}\na_n &= \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}{2}}\\left(q_n + \\frac{i}{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\pi_{-n}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\na^*_n &= \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}{2}}\\left(q_{-n} - \\frac{i}{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\pi_{n}\\right),\\qquad n\\neq 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8}\\] Remember that \\(q_n = q_{-n}^*\\) and \\(\\pi_n = \\pi_{-n}^*\\) in order that \\(u_j\\) and \\(p_j\\) are real. Note that \\(n=0\\) is excluded because \\(\\omega(0)=0\\). These coordinates satisfy \\[\n\\{a_m,a^{*}_n\\}=-i\\delta_{mn}.\n\\] Inverting the definition Equation 8 gives \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_n &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2m\\omega(\\eta_n)}}\\left(a_n + a_{-n}^*\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\n\\pi_n &= -i\\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}{2}}\\left(a_{-n} - a_{n}^*\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\] and inserting into the Hamiltonian Equation 4 gives \\[\nH = \\frac{\\pi_0^2}{2m}+\\sum_{\\substack{n\\neq 0 \\\\ |n| \\leq (N-1)/2}} \\omega(\\eta_n) \\left|a_n\\right|^2,\n\\] with the first term accounting for the (free) centre of mass.",

Exactly the same logic as before tells us that a general energy eigenstate may be written \\[\n\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle = \\prod_{\\substack{n\\neq 0 \\\\ |n| \\leq (N-1)/2}} \\frac{\\left(a^\\dagger_n\\right)^{N_n}}{\\sqrt{N_n!}} \\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\] The non-negative integers \\(\\mathbf{N}=\\left(N_{(1-N)/2},\\ldots, N_{-1}, N_{1}, \\ldots N_{(N-1)/2}\\right)\\) describe the occupation numbers of the oscillators. This eigenstate has energy \\[\nE(\\mathbf{N}) = E_0 + \\sum_{\\substack{n\\neq 0 \\\\ |n| \\leq (N-1)/2}} \\omega(\\eta_n) N_n,\n\\] where the ground state energy is \\[\nE_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\omega(\\eta_n).\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\n\n2.2 Oscillator Quanta are Bosons!\nA key moment in the birth of Quantum Field Theory was the realization that oscillator quanta are bosons, meaning that they can be identified with quantum particles having symmetric wavefunctions. We’ll see this in much more detail in later lectures. For the moment, let’s just note that both have a basis of states described in terms of the occupation numbers, which are non-negative integers. In the case of \\(M\\) bosons, those states were written in terms of the single particle wavefunctions \\(\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\) of the bosons as \\[\n\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{M}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_M)=\\sqrt{\\frac{M!}{\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\mathcal{S}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{M}}(\\mathbf{r}_{M}),\n\\] where \\(\\mathcal{S}=\\frac{1}{M!}\\sum_{P} P\\) is the operation of symmetrization, and \\(N_\\alpha\\) denotes the number of occurrences of \\(\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\) in the product, so that \\(M=\\sum_\\alpha N_\\alpha\\). It turns out that the Hilbert space spanned by these states is the same as that spanned by the states \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle\\), if the labels \\(\\alpha\\) are identified with the momentum labels \\(n\\).\nIt’s important to note that these bosons are totally distinct from the original particles making up the chain. In fact, or original Hamiltonian Equation 1 doesn’t describe indistinguishable particles as written, as each particle is labelled by its position in the chain, with a particle only interacting with its two neighbours. Since the particles are assumed not to change places, there is no way of assigning statistics to their wavefunction.\n\n\n2.3 Thermodynamic (\\(N\\to \\infty\\)) limit\nIn studying the properties of matter, we are usually interested in taking the limit of an infinite system, otherwise known as the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) or thermodynamic limit. At the very least, we expect the internal energy (as well as other thermodynamic potentials) to be an extensive quantity, meaning that it is proportional to the `size’ of the system, here measured by the number of sites. Thus we expect the limit \\[\ne_0 = \\lim_{N\\to \\infty} \\frac{E_0}{N}\n\\] to exist. The separation of the \\(\\eta_n\\) values is \\(2\\pi/N\\), so as \\(N\\to\\infty\\) the sum in ground state energy Equation 9 can be replaced with an integral according to the rule \\[\n\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left(\\cdots\\right) \\xrightarrow{N\\to\\infty} N \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi}\\left(\\cdots\\right).\n\\] The factor of \\(N\\) tells us that we have an extensive quantity, and \\[\ne_0 = \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\omega(\\eta)}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2m}}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{1-\\cos\n\\eta}=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}.\n\\] Alternatively, we may treat the \\(N\\to \\infty\\) limit of the chain as a model of an elastic continuum of length \\(L=aN\\). Take \\(m = \\rho a\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the mass per unit length (1D density). The 1D elastic modulus is \\[\n\\kappa \\equiv \\frac{\\text{tension}}{\\text{strain}} = ka\n\\] Then \\(k/m = \\kappa/(\\rho a^2)\\) and \\[\n\\frac{E_0}{L} = \\left(\\frac{N}{L}\\right)^2\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho}}.\n\\] The energy per unit length diverges as \\(N\\to\\infty\\). Thus the ground state energy of a continuous medium is infinite, on account of the infinite number of degrees of freedom it contains. This is only a problem if one insists on such a description: in practice (at least in condensed matter) there is always discreteness on the smallest scales.\nApart from the infinite ground state energy, the continuum limit of our harmonic system is perfectly well defined. Introducing a continuum displacement by \\(u(x=ja)=u_j\\), the potential energy can be written \\[\nV = \\frac{k}{2} \\sum_j^N (u_j-u_{j+1})^2 \\xrightarrow{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^L dx\\, \\left[u'(x)\\right]^2.\n\\] If we define the momentum density at each point by \\(\\pi(x=ja) = p_j N/L\\), then we find the continuum limit of the canonical commutation relations \\[\n\\left[u(x),\\pi(x')\\right]=i\\delta(x-x'),\n\\] together with the kinetic energy \\[\nT = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac{p_j^2}{2m} = \\frac{1}{2\\rho}\\int_0^L dx\\,\\left[\\pi(x)\\right]^2.\n\\] Since we are taking the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit it’s convenient to define the Fourier modes slightly differently \\[\nu(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty u_n e^{ik_n x},\n\\] where \\(k_n =2\\pi n/L\\). Note that \\(k_n x = \\eta_n j\\). We are recycling the notation \\(u_n\\) now that we have taken the limit.\nIf the momentum density \\(\\pi(x)\\) is then written \\[\n\\pi(x) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{p_{j=xN/L}N}{L} =\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\pi_n e^{-2\\pi i nx /L},\n\\] (This differs from Equation 3 by \\(\\pi_n\\to \\pi_n/\\sqrt{N}\\).) we have \\(\\left[u_m,\\pi_n\\right]=\\delta_{mn}\\).\nOur continuum Hamiltonian \\(H= T+V\\) is then written in Fourier components as \\[\nH = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\left[\\frac{1}{2\\rho L} \\pi_n\\pi_{-n} + \\frac{\\kappa L k_n^2}{2}  u_nu_{-n} \\right].\n\\] We can now read off the dispersion relation \\[\n\\omega(k) = c|k|,\n\\] where \\(c=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho}}\\) is the speed of sound. Note that the continuum limit has lead to a linear dispersion relation. This is reasonable: the lattice was the origin of the periodic dispersion relation Equation 2, and it has now disappeared.\nTranscribing the definition of the oscillator variables Equation 8 gives \\[\n\\begin{align}\na_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\sqrt{ZkL} u_n + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{ZkL}}\\pi_{-n}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\na^*_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\sqrt{ZkL} u_{-n} - \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{ZkL}}\\pi_{n}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(Z\\equiv\\sqrt{\\kappa\\rho}\\) is the impedance. After quantization, the Hamiltonian takes the form \\[\nH - E_0 = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty c\\left|k_n\\right|a^\\dagger_na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_n.\n\\label{coll_excess}\n\\] This expresses the energy above the ground state in terms of the occupancy of the oscillator modes.\n\n\n2.4 Finite Temperature\nAt finite temperature \\(T\\) the occupancies of the modes have thermal averages given by the Bose occupation function \\[\n\\langle N_n \\rangle = n_\\text{B}(\\omega(\\eta_n))\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\beta\\omega(\\eta_n)\\right)-1},\n\\tag{10}\\] where \\(\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_\\text{B}T}\\). The thermal average of the energy of excited states is then \\[\n\\langle H - E_0 \\rangle =\\sum_{|n|\\leq (N-1)/2} \\omega(\\eta_n)n_\\text{B}(\\omega(\\eta_n)).\n\\] This is finite, even in the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit, on account of the exponential tail of Equation 10. Remember that this was the problem that the quantum theory was introduced to solve. At low energies \\(n_{\\text{B}}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\beta\\omega}\\) and the contribution of each mode is \\[\n\\omega n_\\text{B}(\\omega) \\xrightarrow{\\omega\\to 0}  k_\\text{B}T,\n\\] in agreement with the classical equipartition theorem. Were this result to apply at all energies the thermal energy density of a continuum at finite temperature would be infinite (the Ultraviolet Catastrophe). It is the existence of Planck’s constant, which appears in the dimensionless combination \\(\\hbar\\beta\\omega\\) in the Bose occupation function, that allows this conclusion to be avoided.\n\n\n2.5 Position Fluctuations\nClassically, the ground state configuration of our elastic chain corresponds to a regular ‘crystalline’ arrangement of masses at separation \\(a\\), with all \\(u_j=0\\). Mass \\(j\\) and mass \\(k\\) are then separated by \\((j-k)a + u_j-u_k = (j-k)a\\). Quantum mechanically, \\(u_j-u_k\\) fluctuates, even in the ground state. For the notion of a crystal to make sense, these fluctuations should not be too large. Let’s evaluate them for the elastic chain.\nWe want to evaluate \\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_j-u_k\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\label{coll_gsfluct}\n\\] To do this, we write the displacements in terms of the oscillator variables, and then evaluate the expectation values in the ground state using the oscillator algebra. Recall that \\[\nu_j = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} q_n e^{i\\eta_n j},\n\\tag{11}\\] and \\[\nq_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2m\\omega(\\eta_n)}}\\left(a_n + a_{-n}^\\dagger\\right).\n\\] To evaluate \\(\\eqref{coll_gsfluct}\\), we write the two factors \\((u_j-u_k)(u_j-u_k)\\) in terms of the \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_n\\) and \\(a^\\dagger_n\\). Contributions to the ground state expectation value arise from terms with \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_n\\) in the left factor and \\(a^\\dagger_n\\) in the right for some \\(n\\). All other terms vanish. This gives \\[\n\\begin{multline}\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_j-u_k\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle \\\\ = \\frac{1}{2mN} \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\frac{1}{\\omega(\\eta_n)} \\left[e^{i\\eta_n j}- e^{i\\eta_n k}\\right]\\left[e^{-i\\eta_n j}- e^{-i\\eta_n k}\\right].\n\\end{multline}\n\\] Taking the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit in the sum gives \\[\n\\begin{multline}\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_j-u_k\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{mN}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta_n[j-k]\\right)}{\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\\\ = \\frac{1}{m}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta[j-k]\\right)}{\\omega(\\eta)}.\n\\end{multline}\n\\tag{12}\\] The dispersion relation Equation 2 makes this integral a little difficult.\n\n\n\nThe integrand in Equation 12 for \\(j-k=20\\). What form does it take for \\(\\left|j-k\\right|^{-1}\\lesssim\\eta\\lesssim \\pi\\)?.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhen \\(\\left|j-k\\right|\\gg 1\\), the integral is dominated by values of \\(\\left|j-k\\right|^{-1}\\lesssim\\eta\\lesssim \\pi\\). In this limit the dispersion can be linearized\n\\[\n\\omega(\\eta) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}|\\eta|.\n\\] Show that we then have\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_i-u_j\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle \\sim  \\frac{\\ell_\\text{osc}^2}{\\pi} \\log \\left|i-j\\right|,\\qquad \\text{ as } \\left|i-j\\right|\\to\\infty\n\\tag{13}\\]\nwhere we have introduced \\(\\ell_\\text{osc}=\\left(km\\right)^{-1/4}\\), the natural length scale of an oscillator. If you find this derivation a bit vague, an evaluation of the integral Equation 12 is given in the Section 3.2.\n\n\nThe result Equation 13 shows that the uncertainty in the separation of two masses in the chain increases with their separation. This implies that the ground state of the chain is not a crystal, but more closely resembles a fluid. It turns out that this conclusion depends strongly on the dimensionality of the system. In higher dimensions, crystalline ground states do exist (thankfully).\n\n\n2.6 Density Fluctuations\nAn alternative way of quantifying crystalline order is to consider the fluctuations of the density of particles, defined by \\[\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\delta_L(x-x_j),\n\\] where \\(x_j = ja + u_j\\), and \\(\\delta_L(x)\\) is an \\(L\\)-periodic version of the \\(\\delta\\)-function, if we want to stick with a finite size system. Alternatively, we may consider the Fourier components \\[\n\\rho_k = \\sum_{j=1}^N\\exp(-i k x_j).\n\\] Rather than introducing separate notation for the Fourier components of \\(f(x)\\), it’s convenient to denote them by \\(f_q\\), so that \\[\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty f_{k_n} \\exp(ik_n x), \\qquad k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\n\\] In an ordered configuration \\(x_j = ja\\), we would have \\[\n\\rho_{k_n} = \\begin{cases}\nN & n = 0 \\mod N \\\\\n0 & \\text{ otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] These peaks at values of \\(k\\) corresponding to multiples of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\) are nothing but the Bragg peaks observed in a diffraction experiment, which translates the real space crystal arrangement into Fourier space. Note that an overall translation of lattice will just change the phase of the $ _k$, leaving \\(\\left|\\rho_k\\right|^2\\) (proportional to the intensity measured in a diffraction experiment) unchanged.\nHow is this picture altered in the quantum mechanical ground state? Given the above comment, we should evaluate \\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\sum_{j,k=1}^N \\langle{0}\\rvert \\exp(iq[x_j-x_k])\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\tag{14}\\] Upon substituting the mode expansion Equation 11 for the displacements, we are left to evaluate expressions of the form \\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ \\mu a^\\dagger)\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nProve the Hadamard Lemma\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ne^{A}B e^{-A} &= B + \\left[A,B\\right] + \\frac{1}{2!}\\left[A,\\left[A,B\\right]\\right]+\\frac{1}{3!}\\left[A,\\left[A,\\left[A,B\\right]\\right]\\right]+\\ldots \\\\\n&\\equiv e^{\\left[A,\\cdot\\right]}B,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n[Hint: Consider the differential equation in \\(x\\) obeyed by \\(e^{xA}B e^{-xA}\\)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the exponent can be written in a form with all occurrences of \\(a^\\dagger\\) to the left of all \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\) (this operation is called normal ordering; we will meet it again).\n\\[\n\\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ \\mu a^\\dagger) = \\exp(\\lambda \\mu /2) \\exp(\\mu a^\\dagger)\\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}).\n\\] [Hint: Consider the differential equations obeyed by \\(F_1(s)=e^{s(A+B)}\\) and \\(F_2(s)=e^{sA}e^{sB}\\)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nUse this result to show that\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ \\mu a^\\dagger)\\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\exp(\\lambda \\mu /2).\n\\]\n\n\nDeploying this strategy for Equation 14 gives \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\sum_{j,k=1}^N &\\exp(iqa[j-k])\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(-\\frac{q^2}{2mN}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta_n[j-k]\\right)}{\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\n\nNumerical evaluation of \\(\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{0}\\rangle\\) for \\(\\ell_\\text{osc}/a=0.2\\), \\(N=51\\).

Taking the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit with \\(\\left\\|j-k\\right\\|\\gg 1\\) as before, we find that in the vicinity of the first Bragg peak at \\(q=2\\pi/a\\) the summand has the form \\[\n\\exp(i\\Delta q a[j-k])\\, \\left|j-k\\right|^{-2\\pi\\ell_\\text{osc}^2/a^2},\n\\] where \\(\\Delta q\\) denotes the deviation of \\(q\\) from \\(2\\pi/a\\). To find the dependence on \\(\\Delta q\\)\nThis leads to the conclusion \\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{0}\\rangle \\sim \\left(\\Delta q\\right)^{-1+2\\pi\\ell_\\text{osc}^2/a^2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhat happens to the higher Bragg peaks?\n\n\nThus quantum fluctuations replace the Bragg peaks, an indicator of crystalline order, with power law divergences. These remnants of order diminish as \\(\\ell_\\text{osc}/a\\) increases, indicating larger quantum fluctuations. Again, things are different in higher dimensions: the Bragg peaks survive, albeit reduced in strength, at least for small fluctuations. It is possible, however, for quantum fluctuations to prevent crystallization in the ground state (i.e. at zero temperature). Such systems are called quantum liquids. Helium is the prototypical example: the low atomic mass and relatively weak interactions between atoms mean that quantum fluctuations are large.",

    "text": "3 Appendix\n\n3.1 Fourier review\nThis is a good place to collect some facts about Fourier transforms. We start from the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which is a change of basis in a finite dimensional space. This is what we used in discussing the chain. There are then two ways to pass to the infinite continuous case described by the Fourier transform.\n\n3.1.1 Discrete Fourier Transform\nFor a vector \\(x_j = 1,\\ldots N\\) (\\(N\\) taken to be odd), we define the DFT by \\[\nF_n = \\sum_{j=1}^N f_j e^{-i\\eta_n j},\n\\tag{15}\\] where \\(\\eta_n\\equiv \\frac{2\\pi n}{N}\\), and \\(n = -(N-1)/2,\\ldots, (N-1)/2\\). The key to inverting Equation 15 is the observation \\[\n\\sum_{n=-(N-1)/2}^{(N-1)/2} e^{i\\eta_n j} = \\begin{cases}\n0 & j\\neq 0 \\mod N\\\\\nN & j = 0 \\mod N.\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{16}\\]\n\nPerhaps the slickest way to to see this is to observe that \\[\nz^N-1 = (z-1)(1 + z + z^2 +\\cdots z^{N-1})\n\\] Can you fill in the rest of the argument?\n\nThis gives \\[\nf_j = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=-(N-1)/2}^{(N-1)/2}  F_n e^{i\\eta_n j}.\n\\tag{17}\\] A more democratic definition would have \\(1/\\sqrt{N}\\) in both definitions Equation 15 and Equation 17. This would allow us to regard the DFT as a basis change to an orthonormal basis of vectors \\(e^{(n)}_j = \\frac{e^{i\\eta_n j}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\), and both the DFT and its inverse would be unitary transformations.\n\n\n3.1.2 \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit\nIn this limit the \\(\\eta_n\\) values become dense in the range \\((-\\pi,\\pi]\\), with separation \\(\\Delta \\eta = 2\\pi/N\\), and we replace the sum in the inverse DFT Equation 17 by an integral according to the prescription \\[\n\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left(\\cdots\\right) \\xrightarrow{N\\to\\infty} N \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi}\\left(\\cdots\\right),\n\\] giving \\[\nf_j = \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi}\\,F(\\eta) e^{i\\eta j}.\n\\]\n\n\n3.1.3 \\(N\\to\\infty\\), with \\(f_j = f(jL/N)\\),\nAlternatively, regard the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit as sampling a function \\(f(x)\\) ever more finely in the range (0,L]. Now it’s the DFT, rather than the inverse, that becomes an integral \\[\n\\hat f(k) \\equiv \\int_0^L f(x) e^{-ik_n x}\\,dx,\n\\] where \\(k_n =2\\pi n/L\\). Note that \\(k_n x = \\eta_n j\\). The pair of transformations is now \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat f_k &= \\int_0^L f(x) e^{-ik_n x}\\,dx\\nonumber\\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k \\hat f_k e^{ik_n x}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{18}\\] This is the conventional form of the Fourier series for a function with period \\(L\\).\nWith this definition \\(\\hat f_k\\) has an extra dimension of distance (on account of the integral), which gets removed by the \\(1/L\\) in the inverse transform.\nThe analog of the identity Equation 16 is \\[\n\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k e^{ik x} = \\delta_L(x),\n\\] where \\(\\delta_L(x)\\) is an \\(L\\)-periodic version of the \\(\\delta\\)-function.\n\n\n3.1.4 \\(L\\to\\infty\\)\nFinally we arrive at the Fourier transform, where we take \\(L\\to\\infty\\), so that the inverse transform in Equation 18 becomes an integral too \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}(k) & = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) e^{-ik_n x}\\,dx\\nonumber\\\\\nf(x) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat f(k) e^{ik_n x}\\,\\frac{dk}{2\\pi}.\n\\label{coll_FTTrans}\n\\end{align}\n\\] My preference is for taking this limit at the last possible moment, that is, sticking with discrete Fourier sums for as long as possible. There are some good(ish) reasons for this\n\nWriting \\(\\sum_k\\) is easier than \\(L\\int \\frac{dk}{2\\pi}\\), because the \\(k_n = 2\\pi n/L\\) can be left implicit.\nLeaving \\(k\\) as a subscript means we don’t need the tilde to distinguish \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f_k\\).\nThere are times where taking the limit leads to a divergent integral, while the sums remain finite. This almost always tells us that there is something interesting going on when we are trying to pass to an infinite system.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Properties of the Fourier Transform\nHere are some properties that hold for all of the above.\n\nIf \\(f(x)\\) is real \\(f_k = \\left[f_{-k}\\right]^*\\).\nIf \\(f(x)\\) is even, \\(f_k\\) is even.\n(Ergo) if \\(f(x)\\) is real and even, so is \\(f_k\\).\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Fourier Transforms of Products\nFrequently we have to transform products, so we use the convolution theorem \\[\nf(x)g(x) = \\frac{1}{L^2}\\sum_{k,k'}  f_k  g_k = \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_q \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k  f_k  g_{q-k} \\right)e^{iqx},\n\\] which shows us that \\[\nf(x)g(x) \\stackrel{\\text{FT}}{\\longleftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k  f_k  g_{q-k},\n\\] the latter being a discrete convolution.\nFrequently we’ll have to calculate integrals of such products. I record some examples to give you the general idea \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^L f(x)g(x)\\,dx &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k  f_k  g_{-k}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\int_{0}^L f'(x)g'(x)\\,dx &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k k^2 f_k  g_{-k}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\int_{0}^L f(x)g(x)h(x)\\,dx &=  \\frac{1}{L^2}\\sum_{\\substack{k_1,k_2,k_3 \\\\ k_1+k_2+k_3=0}}  f_{k_1} g_{k_2} h_{k_3}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\int_0^\\infty  \\phi(x)V(x-y)\\phi(y)\\,dx \\,dy &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{q}  \\phi_{-q} V_q \\phi_q\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{19}\\] Note that you can be guided to the right number of factors of \\(1/L\\) by dimensional considerations, or from the number of ‘free’ sums over wavevectors.\nFinally, we often encounter the situation where we have two (or more) arguments, but there is only dependence on the difference, for example \\[\nF(x,x') = f(x-x').\n\\] In this case \\[\nF_{k,k'} = f_k\\delta_{k,-k'}.\n\\] In the \\(L\\to\\infty\\) limit this is \\[\n\\hat F(k,k') = \\hat f(k) (2\\pi)\\delta(k+k').\n\\] \\((2\\pi)\\delta(k+k')\\) is the \\(L\\to\\infty\\) limit of \\(L\\delta_{k,-k'}\\) as \\[\n\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k L\\delta_k \\xrightarrow{L\\to\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} 2\\pi \\delta(k)\n\\] With practice, you will find you are able to write down the right hand sides of expressions like Equation 19 without too much difficulty.\n\n\n3.1.7 Higher dimensions\nThis all generalizes to higher dimensions straightforwardly. For example \\[\n\\frac{1}{L^d}\\sum_\\mathbf{k}(\\cdots) \\xrightarrow{L\\to\\infty} \\int (\\cdots) \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^d}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nPractice writing out Equation 19 in \\(d\\) dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Evaluating Equation 12\nWe want to evaluate \\[\nI(j)\\equiv\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta j\\right)}{\\sin(\\eta/2)}d\\eta\n\\] for integer \\(j\\). We can write this as \\[\nI(j)=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1-e^{i\\eta j}}{\\sin(\\eta/2)}d\\eta= -2i\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} e^{i\\eta/2}\\frac{1-e^{i\\eta j}}{1-e^{i\\eta}}d\\eta\n\\] because the imaginary part of the integrand vanishes on integration. Now notice that the integrand involves the geometric series \\[\n\\frac{1-e^{i\\eta j}}{1-e^{i\\eta}} = 1 + e^{i\\eta} + \\cdots e^{i\\eta(j-1)},\n\\] so we can do the integrals term by term to give \\[\nI(j) = 4\\sum_{n=1}^j \\frac{1}{n+1/2}\\sim 4\\log j.\n\\] When all factors are replaced, this yields Equation 13.",

    "text": "2 The Heisenberg Ferromagnetic Chain\n\n2.1 States and operators\nOne spin-1/2 is described by a state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. It’s common to choose as a basis the eigenstates of \\(s^z\\). If we denote these as \\(\\lvert{\\pm}\\rangle\\) with \\(s^z\\lvert{\\pm}\\rangle = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\lvert{\\pm}\\rangle\\), we write \\[\n\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle = \\psi_+\\lvert{+}\\rangle + \\psi_-\\lvert{-}\\rangle=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\psi_+ \\\\\n\\psi_-\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nFor \\(N\\) spins we take basis of product states\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\cdots \\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle, \\qquad \\text{where } \\sigma_j=\\pm.\n\\]\nWe met product states as explicit wavefunctions in Lecture 1. The abstract structure is called a tensor product, normally denoted\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\otimes\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle\n\\]\nWe normally drop the \\(\\otimes\\) for brevity. In the basis of product states a general state of \\(N\\) spin-1/2s is written\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle=\\sum_{\\{\\sigma_j=\\pm\\}}\\Psi_{\\sigma_1\\cdots \\sigma_N}\\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\cdots \\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhat is the dimension of the Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian acts?\n\n\nNow we turn to operators that act on the spins. The spin operators obey the usual commutation relations\n\\[\n[s^a,s^b]=i\\epsilon_{abc}s^c\n\\]\nFor \\(N\\) spins we write \\(s^a_j\\) for a spin operator acting on \\(j^\\text{th}\\) spin\n\\[\ns^a_j\\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\cdots \\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle = \\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\cdots \\lvert{\\sigma_{j-1}}\\rangle (s^a \\lvert{\\sigma_j}\\rangle) \\lvert{\\sigma_{j+1}}\\rangle\\cdots\\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle,\n\\]\nAlternatively, we may express this as\n\\[\ns^a_j = \\overbrace{\\mathbb{1}\\otimes \\cdots \\mathbb{1}}^{j-1}\\otimes s^a \\otimes \\overbrace{\\mathbb{1} \\otimes\\cdots \\mathbb{1}}^{N-j}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhat is \\([s^a_j,s^b_k]\\) for \\(j\\neq k\\)?\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Ground State\nLet’s try and guess some eigenstates. For simplicity we’ll begin with the 1D case, where the spins are arranged in a chain\n\\[\nH = J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathbf{s}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{j+1},\n\\]\nand as usual we take \\(\\mathbf{s}_j=\\mathbf{s}_{j+N}\\) (periodic boundary conditions). Such a system is called a spin chain. Surprisingly enough, crystals do exist in which magnetic atoms are arranged in this way, with only weak coupling between neighbouring chains. So models of this type are a useful description, at least in some energy window, of real materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhat is the dimension of the Hilbert in which the Hamiltonian acts?\n\n\nSince Equation 1 is supposed to be a model for a magnet, we might try the state with all spins aligned\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle \\equiv \\prod_{j=1}^N \\lvert{+}\\rangle_j,\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere for brevity we write \\(\\lvert{+}\\rangle_j = \\lvert{s^z=+1/2}\\rangle_j\\). It’s not hard to check that this is an eigenstate with energy \\(E_0\\equiv JN/4\\). Furthermore it’s an eigenstate of \\(S^z\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}^2\\), where \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is the total spin\n\\[\n\\mathbf{S} = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathbf{s}_j.\n\\]\nThe eigenvalues are \\(S^z = N/2\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}^2 = \\frac{N}{2}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right)\\). The rotational invariance of the Hamiltonian implies that the state \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\) should be a member of a multiplet of \\(N+1\\) degenerate eigenstates related by rotations. These states can be generated by acting on \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\) with \\(S^-=S^x-iS^y\\). The first is\n\\[\nS^-\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^N s^-_j\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\lvert{+}\\rangle_1\\lvert{+}\\rangle_2\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j-1} \\lvert{-}\\rangle_j\\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j+1}\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_N.\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nVerify that \\(S^z = N/2-1\\), but that \\(\\mathbf{S}^2\\) and \\(H\\) are unchanged.\n\n\nEquation 2 is a superposition of terms with one spin flipped. If we continue the process to explore the whole multiplet, we will at each state end up with a constant amplitude superposition of all states with two spins flipped (for \\(S^z=N/2-2\\)), three flipped (for \\(S^z=N/2-3\\)) and so on.\nAre these the ground states for \\(J&lt;0\\)? One way to convince ourselves is to write the Hamiltonian as\n\\[\nH = J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathbf{s}_j \\cdot\\mathbf{s}_{j+1} = J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[(\\mathbf{s}_j+\\mathbf{s}_{j+1})^2-\\mathbf{s}_j^2 - \\mathbf{s}_{j+1}^2\\right]\n= -\\frac{3JN}{2} + J \\sum_{j=1}^N (\\mathbf{s}_j+\\mathbf{s}_{j+1})^2.\n\\]\nIt’s then clear that the last term is minimized if every neighbouring pair of spins has total spin \\(1\\), as they do for \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\). Are there other states that satisfy this condition?\n\n\n2.3 First Excited States\nWhat about just one of the states in the superposition Equation 2?\n\\[\n\\lvert{j}\\rangle = \\lvert{+}\\rangle_1\\lvert{+}\\rangle_2\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j-1} \\lvert{-}\\rangle_j\\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j+1}\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_N.\n\\]\nIs this an eigenstate? Let’s try acting on this state with the Hamiltonian. It’s convenient to write the terms in the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in terms of raising and lowering operators\n\\[\n\\mathbf{s}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{j+1} = s^z_js^z_{j+1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(s^+_js^-_{j+1} +s^-_js^+_{j+1}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\ns^+ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad s^- = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nNow note that\n\\[\n\\left(s^+_j s^-_{j+1} +s^-_js^+_{j+1}\\right)\\lvert{+}\\rangle_j\\lvert{-}\\rangle_{j+1} = \\lvert{-}\\rangle_j\\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j+1}.\n\\]\nIt then follows that the action of \\(H\\) on the state \\(\\lvert{j}\\rangle\\) is\n\\[\nH\\lvert{j}\\rangle = (1-N/4) \\lvert{j}\\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lvert{j-1}\\rangle+\\lvert{j+1}\\rangle\\right).\n\\]\n(I’ve set \\(J=-1\\) as it’s the only scale in the problem, so no harm done.) Acting with \\(H\\) therefore leaves us within the subspace spanned by the states \\(\\lvert{j}\\rangle\\). It had to, of course: this is the subspace with \\(S_z=N/2-1\\). We can think of down spins as being like particles, with the Hamiltonian conserving their number.\nWe can easily diagonalize \\(H\\) in this space by noting that it corresponds to a circulant matrix. As we saw in Lecture 3, the eigenstates are plane waves\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\eta}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\\eta j}\\lvert{j}\\rangle,\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwith \\(\\eta = \\frac{2\\pi n}{N}\\), \\(n = -(N-1)/2,\\ldots, (N-1)/2\\). The eigenvalues are \\(E = E_0 + \\omega(\\eta)\\), with\n\\[\n\\omega(\\eta) = 2\\sin^2\\eta/2.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNote that the dispersion relation is periodic, as in the case of the elastic chain, but is now quadratic, rather than linear, at small \\(\\eta\\). \\(\\eta=0\\) corresponds to the state Equation 2, and indeed the energy \\(\\omega(0)=0\\) in that case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a general principle at work here: excitations that correspond at long wavelengths to symmetry operations have to have gapless dispersion relations. In field theory this follows from a general result called Goldstone’s theorem.\n\n\n\nIf we are thinking of the down spin as a particle, then the eigenstates Equation 3 are like plane wave states. These excitations are known as magnons.\n\n\n2.4 \\(N\\)-Magnon States\nAny system at finite temperature has a finite energy density, or a total energy proportional to the system size. Since a magnon has a microscopic energy set by \\(J\\), such a system will presumably have many magnons (many flipped spins). As we increase the number of flipped spins, we increase the size of the subspace in which \\(H\\) acts – it has dimension \\(\\binom{N}{n}\\) for \\(n\\) flipped spins i.e. \\(S^z = N/2-n\\). Things are obviously going to get difficult quickly! The case of two magnons is discussed in the Appendix. It turns out that for the Heisenberg model we are lucky, and we even know the form of a general energy eigenstate with \\(n\\) flipped spin. It’s called Bethe’s ansatz and we’ll meet it in Lecture 15.\nWe started our discussion with the ground state of the ferromagnetic \\(J&lt;0\\) Heisenberg model. What about \\(J&gt;0\\)? Can we guess the ground state in this case (of course, that’s equivalent to finding the highest excited state of the ferromagnet). Bethe’s ansatz tells us that it must be some complicated gas of magnons, all scattering off each other. Why are things so complicated?\n\n\n2.5 Antiferromagnets Are Different!\nLet’s try and guess the ground state of the antiferromagnet. Since anti-aligning spins should be favoured, we might try\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle  \\equiv \\lvert{+}\\rangle_1\\lvert{-}\\rangle_{2}\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_{N-1}\\lvert{-}\\rangle_{N},\n\\tag{5}\\]\nassuming \\(N\\) is even. Acting with the \\(H\\) reveals that we are out of luck, however. The reason is simple: regarding the down spins as particles arranged on every other site, the spin flip terms of the Hamiltonian cause them to move about. This is Bethe’s dense gas of interacting magnons.\nBut antiferromagnets, with the kind of alternating order described by Equation 5 do exist! In fact, their existence was predicted by Louis Néel in 1936 before their experimental discovery. Equation 5 is sometimes called a Néel state for this reason. In Section 5.2 you’ll find a discussion of what we mean when say that a system has an antiferromagnetic ground state, using a simple model.\nThe Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chain does not have an antiferromagnetic ground state. The reason, as we’ll see, is similar to that behind the absence of Bragg peaks in the elastic chain: quantum fluctuations are too strong. On the square and cubic lattices, the Heisenberg model does display antiferromagnetism in the ground state. The above considerations show us, however, that these states are a bit more complicated than Equation 5.",

    "section": "3 Large \\(s\\) Expansion",
    "text": "3 Large \\(s\\) Expansion\nA common strategy when faced with an intractable model is to generalize it to a family of models indexed by a parameter that may be used as an expansion parameter in some approximation scheme. In this section we’ll see an example of this approach by generalizing the Heisenberg model to arbitrary spin.\n\n3.1 Holstein–Primakoff Representation of Spin\nThis is a way of representing spins in terms of oscillator variables so that a problem of coupled spins becomes a problem of coupled oscillators, of the kind we studied in Lecture 3. Since the map is nonlinear, the problem is not harmonic, although a harmonic approximation is a useful first step that turns out to be justified when the spins are large.\nThe representation is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ns^+ &=\\sqrt{2s}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}}{2s}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\\\\ns^- &= \\sqrt{2s}a^\\dagger\\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}}{2s}} \\\\\ns^z &= \\left(s - a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nI’m going to leave it up to you to confirm that \\([a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}},a^\\dagger]=1\\) reproduces the spin commutation relations, and this problem from Problem Set 1 should demystify why this works to some extent. A rough understanding is as follows. \\(s^{\\pm}\\) and \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\), \\(a^\\dagger\\) evidently have something in common in that they shift us up and down a ladder of states. That’s why the relation between \\(s^z\\) and the number of quanta in the oscillator is so simple. The oscillator ground state corresponds to \\(\\lvert{s,s}\\rangle\\).\nThe difference is that in the spin case the ladder is finite, while in the oscillator it is (semi-)infinite. Thus we can’t just have \\(s^+\\propto a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\). We must have something that stops us lowering beyond \\(s^z=-s\\), corresponding to \\(2s\\) oscillator quanta. That’s the function of the factor in the square root in \\(s^-\\).\n\n\n3.2 Harmonic Spin Waves\nA large \\(s\\) approximation already presents itself\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ns^+ &\\sim \\sqrt{2s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\nonumber\\\\\ns^- &\\sim  \\sqrt{2s}a^\\dagger\\nonumber\\\\\ns_z &= \\left(s - a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe are neglecting terms of order \\(s^{-1/2}\\). The point about this approximation is that it is just what is needed to turn our Heisenberg Hamiltonian into a quadratic oscillator Hamiltonian. We get \\[\nH = J\\sum_j \\left[(s-a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j)(s-a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j) + sa^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1}+s a^\\dagger_{j+1}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\right].\n\\] This isn’t quadratic, but note that the quartic terms have a lower power of \\(s\\), so in the same approximation we should drop them to give \\[\n\\begin{equation}\nH \\sim NJs^2 + sJ\\sum_j \\left[a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1}+a^\\dagger_{j+1}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j - 2a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\right].\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{7}\\] We can already see that the state with no quanta (\\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle=0\\)) is an eigenstate. In fact this is just the spin-\\(s\\) generalization of the state \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\) \\[\n\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle_s \\equiv \\prod_{j=1}^N \\lvert{s,s}\\rangle_j,\n\\] and is the ground state for \\(J&lt;0\\). We could continue to analyze Equation 7 in terms of the operators \\(a^\\dagger_j\\) and \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\) see this problem from Problem Sheet 1, but instead we’re going to write Equation 6 as\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ns^x &\\sim \\sqrt{s}x \\nonumber\\\\\ns^y &\\sim  \\sqrt{s}p\\nonumber\\\\\ns_z &= \\left(s - \\frac{1}{2}[x^2 + p^2 - 1] \\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+a^\\dagger)\\) and \\(p = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(a^\\dagger-a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}})\\) are canonical position and momentum coordinates.\nDoing this for each spin in our chain gives the Hamiltonian\n\\[\nH\\sim NJ s^2 + sNJ+ \\overbrace{sJ \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[x_j x_{j+1} + p_j p_{j+1}-x_j^2 - p_j^2\\right]}^{\\equiv H^{(2)}} + \\ldots,\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere we are dropping terms that are lower order in \\(s\\). Equation 8 has the form of an harmonic chain, albeit one with a rather strange looking mass term. We can diagonalize it by using the Fourier expansion of the position and momentum as before\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_j(t) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} q_n(t) e^{i\\eta_n j},\\nonumber\\\\\np_j(t) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\pi_n(t) e^{-i\\eta_n j}.\n\\label{spin_Fourier}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn terms of these modes \\(H^{(2)}\\) takes the form\n\\[\nH^{(2)} = -2sJ \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\sin^2(\\eta_n/2)\\left[q_n q_{-n} + \\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right].\n\\tag{9}\\]\nComparing with our treatment of the elastic chain, we can read of the dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{FM}}(\\eta) = 4s\\left|J\\right|\\sin^2(\\eta/2)\n\\]\nin agreement with Equation 4 for \\(s=1/2\\). Incidentally, in order that the ground state energy is \\(NJ s^2\\) with no correction at order \\(s\\), the ground state energy of the oscillators must cancel the second term of Equation 8. In other words, \\[\n\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\sin^2(\\eta_n/2)\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left[q_n q_{-n} + \\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right]\\lvert{0}\\rangle=\\frac{N}{2}.\n\\tag{10}\\]\nThe harmonic approximation applies close to the ferromagnetic state, where there are few oscillator quanta. If the typical values of \\(a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\) are small — we’ve seen \\(a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j=0\\) in the ground state — the approximation \\(\\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j}{2s}}\\sim 1\\) that gave rise to Equation 6 is justified, and neglecting anharmonic terms is reasonable.\nWhat about the case of antiferromagnetic coupling (\\(J&gt;0\\))? Even though the generalization of Equation 5\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle_s \\equiv \\lvert{s,s}\\rangle_1\\lvert{s,-s}\\rangle_{2}\\cdots \\lvert{s,s}\\rangle_{N-1}\\lvert{s,-s}\\rangle_{N},\n\\]\nis not a ground state, it might be close. We can’t apply the approximation Equation 6 directly, however, because this state has zero quanta on the odd sites, but \\(2s\\) quanta on the odd sites. To apply our approximation to states close to \\(\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle_s\\) we rotate every other spin through \\(\\pi\\) about the \\(y\\) axis, so that\n\\[\n(s^x_j,s^y_j,s^z_j)\\longrightarrow (-s^x_j,s^y_j,-s^z_j),\\quad j\\text{ odd}.\n\\]\nThe Heisenberg chain Hamiltonian then becomes\n\\[\nH = -J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[s^x_j s^x_{j+1} - s^y_j s^y_{j+1} + s^z_j s^z_{j+1}\\right].\n\\]\nNow we proceed exactly as before. In approximating this Hamiltonian by a harmonic description close to the ferromagnetic state \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle_s\\), we are in fact working close to the antiferromagnetic state \\(\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle_s\\) in the original variables. The oscillator Hamiltonian is now\n\\[\nH^{(2)} = 2sJ \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left[\\sin^2(\\eta/2)q_n q_{-n} + \\cos^2(\\eta/2)\\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right],\n\\tag{11}\\]\ncorresponding to a dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{AFM}}(\\eta) = 2sJ\\left|\\sin(\\eta)\\right|.\n\\tag{12}\\]\nThis is rather different to the ferromagnetic case. Note that it vanishes both \\(\\eta=0\\) and at the Brillouin zone boundary \\(\\eta=\\pi\\), and is linear in the vicinity of both points, compared with the quadratic behaviour of the ferromagnet. The reason for the difference is clear on comparing Equation 9 and Equation 11. In the first case both the position and momentum terms vanish at \\(\\eta=0\\), while in the second only the position term vanishes here, with the momentum term vanishing at \\(\\eta=\\pi\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nCan you figure out why?\n\n\nIncidentally, the Bethe ansatz solution of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain yields dispersion relation for the lowest excited state of momentum \\(\\eta\\) (des Cloiseaux–Pearson dispersion)\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{dCP}}(\\eta) = \\frac{\\pi J}{2}\\left|\\sin(\\eta)\\right|,\n\\tag{13}\\]\nwhich has the same functional form, but with a different overall scale. You shouldn’t read too much into this, as our calculation is valid at large \\(s\\).\nThe halving of the period of the dispersion Equation 12 is due to the antiferromagnetic order doubling the size of the unit cell. Although the exact result has the same feature, there is in fact no antiferromagnetic order in the chain, as we’ll see next.\n\n\n3.3 Quantum Fluctuations Degrade Antiferromagnetic Order\nIn the crudest approximation \\(s^z_j \\sim  s\\) in the ferromagnet and \\(s^z_j \\sim s(-1)^j\\) in the antiferromagnet. This corresponds to perfect order. However, the Holstein–Primakoff representation has\n\\[\ns^z_j = s - a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j.\n\\]\nHow does the second term effect \\(\\langle{0}\\rvert s^z_j \\lvert{0}\\rangle\\) in the ground state of \\(H^{(2)}\\)? In the case of the ferromagnet, it doesn’t. We know the ground state has \\(s^z = s\\) exactly. One way to see why the second term doesn’t contribute is to note that by translational invariance\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\langle{0}\\rvert\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\tag{14}\\]\nEvaluating this in terms of the normal modes gives\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^N a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left(x_j^2 + p_j^2 - 1\\right) = -\\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_n \\left(q_n q_{-n} + \\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right).\n\\label{spin_DepEval}\n\\]\nThis commutes with the harmonic Hamiltonian Equation 9, and is zero in the ground state (c.f. Equation 10). In fact, this is an exact statement not restricted to the harmonic approximation: the total number of Holstein–Primakoff bosons is conserved. The same is not true for the antiferromagnetic case Equation 9. If we had written this Hamiltonian in terms of the operators \\(a^\\dagger_j\\), \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\), we would have found terms involving \\(a^\\dagger_ja^\\dagger_{j+1}\\) and \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1}\\) that create pairs of bosons (see this problem).\nNext we use the oscillator coordinates just as in Lecture 3. Since we want to express Equation 11 in terms of ladder operators, we have to adapt our definition accordingly. For \\(\\eta\\neq 0, \\pi\\) the operators\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta &= \\sqrt{\\frac{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}{2}}\\left(q_n + \\frac{i}{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}\\pi_{-n}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\na^\\dagger_\\eta &= \\sqrt{\\frac{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}{2}}\\left(q_{-n} - \\frac{i}{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}\\pi_{n}\\right),\\qquad \\eta=2\\pi n/N\n\\label{spin_adef}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nsatisfy\n\\[\n\\sin^2(\\eta/2)q_n q_{-n} + \\cos^2(\\eta/2)\\pi_n\\pi_{-n}=\\frac{\\omega(\\eta)}{2}\\left[a^\\dagger_\\eta a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta+a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta a^\\dagger_\\eta\\right].\n\\]\nThis puts the Hamiltonian Equation 11 in the desired form, so we know that the ground state satisfies \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta\\lvert{\\text{GS}}\\rangle=0\\)\nTo evaluate Equation 14, we write it in terms of \\(a^\\dagger_\\eta\\), \\(a_\\eta\\) to give\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta s &= - \\langle{0}\\rvert\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4N}\\sum_n \\left[|\\tan(\\eta_n/2)| + |\\cot(\\eta_n/2)|\\right].\\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}- \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\left[|\\tan(\\eta_n/2)| + |\\cot(\\eta_n/2)|\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis represents an \\(O(s^0)\\) correction to \\(\\langle s^z_j\\rangle = (-1)^j\\left(s - \\Delta s\\right)\\). However, the integral diverges logarithmically at \\(\\eta=0\\) and \\(\\eta=\\pi\\).\nThis indicates that our approach breaks down in the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit: at finite \\(N\\) the sums are all finite if \\(\\eta=0, \\pi\\) are excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhy can we do this? Compare with the elastic chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nRepeat the analysis on a 2D square lattice. You should find an integral over the two-dimensional Brillouin zone. Do you find divergences?\n\n\nThe breakdown of the spin wave treatment in 1D has a physical meaning: there is no long range antiferromagnetic order, even at zero temperature. The situation is closely analogous to the elastic chain, where we saw that quantum fluctuations destroyed the Bragg peaks.",

    "text": "4 A Numerical Experiment\nTo make this a bit more concrete, let’s look at the results of a brute force numerical computation of the spectrum (code). Recall that the dimension of the Hilbert space is \\(2^N\\), so only relatively small chains are tractable. Here, we have \\(N=26\\), corresponding to a whopping \\(2^{26}=67108864\\) states!

    "text": "5 Appendix\n\n5.1 Two-Magnon states\nLet’s look at the \\(n=2\\) case. The most general state with two magnons can be written\n\\[\n\\sum_{j&gt;k} c_{j,k}s_j^-s_k^-\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle,\n\\tag{15}\\]\nwith some set of coefficients \\(c_{jk}\\). Note that \\(j=k\\) doesn’t contribute: we can’t lower the spin twice, so two magnons can’t be on the same site. Also, we don’t need to include \\(c_{j,k}=c_{k,j}\\) – magnons are bosons – so we only include \\(j&gt;k\\).\nUsing our particle picture, we might suppose that if the magnons are separated from each other they can be described by plane waves. Thus we might expect something like\n\\[\nc_{j,k}\\sim \\exp(i\\eta_1 j + i\\eta_2 k)\n\\label{spin_2Plane}\n\\]\nto work. Acting on Equation 15 with the Hamiltonian gives the eigenvalue equation for the energy \\(E = E_0 +\\epsilon\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n2c_{j,k} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_{j+1,k}+c_{j-1,k}+c_{j,k+1}+c_{j,k-1}\\right) &= \\epsilon c_{j,k},\\quad j&gt;k+1 \\nonumber\\\\\nc_{j,j-1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_{j+1,j-1}+c_{j,j-2}\\right) &= \\epsilon c_{j,j-1}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{16}\\]\nWe can think of this as a lattice analog of the two particle Schrödinger equation. The modification when \\(j=k+1\\) occurs because\n\nThere are only two bonds where the spin changes, instead of 4 when \\(j&gt;k+1\\). Thus the ‘on-site’ term is -4 not -8. This plays the role of a nearest neighbour attractive interaction between magnons.\nMagnons can’t hop on top of each other.\n\nThe first of Equation 16 is solved by\n\\[\nc_{j,k} = c_1  \\exp(i\\eta_1 j + i\\eta_2 k) + c_2  \\exp(i\\eta_1 k + i\\eta_2 j),\\quad \\text{ for } j&gt;k+1\n\\tag{17}\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\omega(\\eta_1)+\\omega(\\eta_2).\n\\]\nThe eigenvalue is thus fixed by \\(\\eta_1\\) and \\(\\eta_2\\). In turn, their possible values are determined by some quantization condition, as in the Lieb–Liniger model, but we leave this aside for the moment. First, we must use the \\(j=k+1\\) equation to determine the relationship between \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\).\nThere’s a clever way to do this. First, even though we know \\(c_{j,j}=0\\) is really zero, we extend the first of Equation 16 to \\(j=k+1\\), and this equation then involves a ‘fake’ \\(c_{j,j}\\). The advantage of this is that we can then extend the form Equation 17 to \\(j=k+1\\) and \\(j=k\\). For this to work, the correct equation for \\(j=k+1\\) – the second of Equation 16 – must be consistent with the first. This gives the condition\n\\[\n-c_{k+1,k} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_{k,k} + c_{k+1,k+1}\\right) = 0.\n\\]\nUsing the form Equation 17 gives a relationship between \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\)\n\\[\n-2\\left(c_1 e^{i\\eta_1}+c_2 e^{i\\eta_2}\\right) + (c_1+c_2)(1+e^{i(\\eta_1+\\eta_2)}),\n\\]\nwith solution\n\\[\n\\frac{c_1}{c_2} = -\\frac{e^{i(\\eta_2-\\eta_1)/2}-\\cos[(\\eta_1+\\eta_2)/2]}{e^{i(\\eta_1-\\eta_2)/2}-\\cos[(\\eta_1+\\eta_2)/2]}\\equiv e^{i\\phi},\n\\tag{18}\\]\nwhere we have defined the scattering phase shift, just as in the Lieb–Liniger model. The physical picture is therefore that a pair of magnons scatter elastically off each other, their wavefunction acquiring a phase shift as they do.\nReturning to our particle analogy, the existence of an attractive potential for magnons suggests we should allow for the possibility of bound states. Doing so requires complex \\(\\eta_{1,2}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\eta_1 = u + i v,\\quad\n\\eta_2 = u - i v,\\quad v&gt;0.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe also require that \\(c_2=0\\) in Equation 17, otherwise the eigenstate doesn’t decay. From Equation 18 we see that\n\\[\ne^{-v} = \\cos u.\n\\]\nThe total momentum of the state is \\(K=2u\\), and evaluating the energy gives\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\text{bound}(K) = \\omega(\\eta_1) + \\omega(\\eta_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos K).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nAs a function of momentum, compare the bound state energy with the lowest energy of two free magnons.\n\n\n\n\n5.2 The Anderson Tower\nWe consider a simple model due to Philip Anderson. The couplings of the nearest neighbour Heisenberg model on the chain, square and cubic lattices define a bipartite graph. This means that the sites (or vertices of the graph) can be grouped into two sets, with couplings only between the two sets (not within). Thus in the chain, the two sets are the even and odd sites. We call these two sets sublattice \\(A\\) and sublattice \\(B\\).\nSince it seems to be hard to solve the Heisenberg model, we simplify it in the following way (this discussion follows {% cite Lhuillier:2006aa %}). Introduce the Fourier components of the spin\n\\[\n\\mathbf{s}_\\mathbf{j} =  \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}} \\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{\\eta} e^{i \\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\cdot \\mathbf{j}}.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) denotes a \\(d\\)-dimensional vector of integers \\(\\mathbf{j}=(j_1,\\ldots j_d)\\), \\(j=1,\\ldots N\\) giving the position of the spin in an \\(\\overbrace{N\\times N \\times \\cdots N}^{d\\text{ times}}\\) cubic lattice, and likewise\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\eta} = (\\eta_1,\\ldots \\eta_d) = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}(n_1,\\ldots n_d),\\quad n_a = -N/2+1,\\ldots N/2\n\\]\ngives all the wavevectors in the Brillouin zone. It’s easier to assume \\(N\\) is even here, to accommodate antiferromagnetic order. In terms of \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\), the \\(d\\)-dimensional version of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian Equation 1 on the square / cubic / hypercubic lattice can be written\n\\[\nH = JN^d\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\in \\text{BZ}}\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{\\boldsymbol{-\\eta}},\n\\label{spin_HbergFT}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^d\\cos(\\eta_j)\\). Now we are going to do something drastic and throw away all wavevectors apart from \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}=\\boldsymbol{0}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}  = (\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)\\). The motivation is that\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{0} = \\mathcal{N}^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B\\right), \\qquad\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{(\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)} = \\mathcal{N}^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A - \\mathbf{S}_B\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{S}_A\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}_B\\) are the total spins of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) sublattices, and \\(\\mathcal{N}= N^d\\) is the total number of sites. Since antiferromagnetism involves anti-alignment of spins on the different sublattices, the second component should be particularly important. Our simplified Hamiltonian is then\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_{AB} &= \\frac{J}{\\mathcal{N}}\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B\\right)^2 - \\left(\\mathbf{S}_A - \\mathbf{S}_B\\right)^2\\right]\\\\\n& = \\frac{4J}{\\mathcal{N}}\\mathbf{S}_A\\cdot \\mathbf{S}_B.\n\\label{spin_HAB}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n(Note that \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{(\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)}=\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{-(\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)}\\)) Relative to the original model, this has the unphysical feature that every sublattice \\(A\\) spin is interacting with every sublattice \\(B\\) spin. The factor of \\(N^{-d}\\) does guarantee that we’ll have an extensive energy, however.\nWhat is the ground state of \\(H_{AB}\\), assuming \\(J&gt;0\\)? This is easily answered by writing the Hamiltonian as\n\\[\nH = \\frac{2J}{\\mathcal{N}} \\left[\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B\\right)^2 - \\mathbf{S}_A^2 - \\mathbf{S}_B^2\\right].\n\\tag{19}\\]\nIt’s clear that we should form two spins of maximal size \\(\\mathcal{N}/4\\) from each of the two sublattices, and then combine them to make an overall spin singlet. Obviously this singlet is a spherically symmetric state with no preferred direction, and hence no antiferromagnetic order. The ground state energy is\n\\[\nE_0 = -J\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{N}}{4}+1\\right),\n\\]\nwhich is extensive. What about the excited states? There are two options for the first excited states:\n\nStick with spins of size \\(\\mathcal{N}/4\\) for the sublattices, but combine them to make a total spin \\(S&gt;0\\).\nMake smaller spins on the sublattices, and combine them.\n\nIn the first case, the energy of excitation above the ground state is\n\\[\nE_S - E_0 = \\frac{2J}{\\mathcal{N}} S(S+1),\n\\]\nwith degeneracy \\(2S+1\\). In the second case, reducing \\(S_A\\to \\mathcal{N}/4 - 1\\) means that \\(\\Delta\\mathbf{S}_A^2 = -\\frac{\\mathcal{N}}{8}\\). From Equation 19 we see that this is going to cause the energy to increase by an amount of order \\(J\\), while in the first case our excitations were of order \\(J/\\mathcal{N}\\). The two kinds of excitations only have comparable energies when \\(S\\) is \\(O(\\sqrt{N})\\). For smaller values of \\(S\\) the “type 1” states have a lower energy\nLet’s describe the type 1 energy states in more detail. The two spins of magnitude \\(S_A = S_B = \\frac{\\mathcal{N}}{4}\\) can be combined to make a total spin between \\(\\mathcal{N}/2\\) and \\(0\\) (assuming \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) even). We can thus decompose the Hilbert space of the two spins as\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}_A\\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B = \\mathcal{H}^{(0)}\\oplus\\mathcal{H}^{(1)}\\oplus\\cdots \\mathcal{H}^{(\\mathcal{N}/2)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{H}^{(S)}\\) is the Hilbert space of a spin \\(S\\).\nNow we consider a superficially different problem: a particle of mass \\(M\\) moving on a sphere of radius \\(R\\), with Hamiltonian\n\\[\nH_\\text{rotor} = \\frac{ \\mathbf{L}^2}{2MR^2},\n\\label{spin_rotor}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}\\) is the orbital angular momentum. The eigenstates of the particle, or rotor, are spherical harmonics \\(Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\), with energy\n\\[\nE_{lm} = \\frac{L(L+1)}{2MR^2},\\qquad m=-l,\\ldots, l.\n\\]\nThus the eigenstates and eigenergies of our model spin Hamiltonian can be identified with those of the rotor up to \\(l=\\mathcal{N}/2\\). What plays the role of the direction of the rotor \\(\\mathbf{r}= R\\mathbf{n}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is a unit vector? Here are some things we know about \\(\\mathbf{n}\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{L}\\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0,\\quad \\mathbf{n}^2 = 1\\\\\n[L_j,n_k] = i\\epsilon_{jkl}n_l,\\quad [n_j,n_k]=0.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{20}\\]\nWe get the same relations at large \\(N\\) if we make the identifications\n\\[\n\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B,\\quad \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{2}{\\mathcal{N}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A - \\mathbf{S}_B\\right),\n\\]\nas long as we stick to \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) of \\(O(\\sqrt{\\mathcal{N}})\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nEvaluate the expressions Equation 20 and see that they are fulfilled in the limit \\(\\mathcal{N}\\to\\infty\\).\n\n\nThus the Néel vector \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) acts like the axis of a heavy rotor. Although it is certainly true that the ground state of the rotor is the \\(l=0\\) state, which is delocalized over the sphere, it is possible to form a localized state of the rotor using a superposition of the \\(l&gt;0\\) states – sometimes called the Anderson tower – which have energies that vanish as \\(\\mathcal{N}\\to \\infty\\). The dynamics of such a superposition is therefore very slow. Alternatively, we may imagine that small perturbations from the outside world lift the spherical symmetry of the problem, causing the true ground state to be localized in one direction. The strength of perturbation necessary goes to zero as \\(\\mathcal{N}\\to 0\\). In either case, the result is that a thermodynamically large system will at any instant in time be observed to be ordered in a particular direction, and that direction will change infinitesimally slowly. This situation is usually described as spontaneous symmetry breaking – not a brilliant term given the above discussion.",

Even more surprisingly, our understanding of these phases rests largely on guessing the right wavefunction to describe these strongly interacting systems. How is such a thing possible?

    "text": "2 Filled LLL of Fermions\nLet’s imagine filling the LLL with fermions. As it stands, there’s no principle to suggest how we do this, as all the states are degenerate. We can lift that degeneracy by adding a rotationally symmetric harmonic potential \\[\nV_\\text{harm}(x,y) = \\frac{v}{2}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right) = \\frac{v}{2}\\left|z\\right|^2.\n\\tag{2}\\] When this potential acts on a state in the LLL, the result is not a LLL state because of the appearance of \\(\\bar z\\) in \\(V\\). Let’s suppose that the cyclotron energy \\(\\omega_c\\) that gives the spacing between Landau levels is the largest energy scale in the problem. Then we should consider only the action of \\(V\\) in the LLL subspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nBy considering matrix elements \\(\\langle{f_1}\\rvert V\\lvert{f_2}\\rangle\\) between LLL states, show (by integrating by parts) that it is possible to replace any occurrence of \\(\\bar z\\) in \\(V\\) with \\(2\\partial_z\\) acting on the analytic part of the wavefunction.\nNote that the order is important: all the \\(\\partial_z\\) must stand to the left of the \\(z\\), Thus \\[\nV_\\text{harm}\\longrightarrow v\\partial_z z =  v\\left(1+z \\partial_z\\right).\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\n\nApplied to the basis states \\(f_n(z)\\), \\(V\\) just counts the degree: \\(V_\\text{harm} f_n = v(1+n)f_n\\). The ground state of noninteracting fermions therefore just amounts to filling the states \\(\\lvert{f_n}\\rangle\\) from the bottom. Identical arguments to those used in discussing the Fermi gas on the ring then tell us that the ground state wavefunction of \\(N\\) fermions is \\[\n\\Psi(z_1,\\ldots, z_N) = \\prod_{j&lt;k}^N (z_j-z_k) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{j=1}^N\\left|z_j\\right|^2\\right)\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the density is \\[\n\\rho_1(z,\\bar z) = \\frac{e^{-|z|^2/2}}{2\\pi}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\left|z\\right|^{2n}}{2^n n!} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(N,|z|^2/2)}{(N-1)!}.\n\\tag{5}\\] Here \\(\\Gamma(s,x) = \\int^\\infty_x t^{s-1}e^{-t}dt\\) is the incomplete gamma function.\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity of particles in the LLL for \\(N=100\\)\n\n\nAt small \\(\\left\\|z\\right\\|\\), we can approximate the sum in Equation 5 by extending the upper limit to \\(\\infty\\), and we have \\(\\rho_1\\to \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\). In fact, the density is fixed at this value until we reach \\(\\sim\\sqrt{2N}\\), at which point the density falls to zero on the scale of the magnetic length.\nThus, with the potential Equation 2, the filled LLL is described by a circular droplet of fixed density \\(\\rho_1 = 1/(2\\pi)\\), consistent with one state per flux quantum, which is the known degeneracy of the LLL. This picture is in fact quite general: changing the confining potential would cause the droplet to deform, but the density to remain constant (on the macroscopic scale).",

    "section": "3 The Laughlin Wavefunction",
    "text": "3 The Laughlin Wavefunction\nThe theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect begins with Robert Laughlin’s famous wavefunction Laughlin (1983) generalizing Equation 4 \\[\n\\Psi_m(z_1,\\ldots, z_N) = \\prod_{j&lt;k}^N (z_j-z_k)^{m} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{j=1}^N\\left|z_j\\right|^2\\right).\n\\tag{6}\\] For this wavefunction to describe fermions, \\(m\\) must be odd. Even \\(m\\) describes bosons. I want to emphasize first that despite the superficial similarity of Equation 4 and Equation 6, they are very different beasts. While Equation 4 is an (antisymmetric) product state Equation 6 is not, and indeed its expansion in product states is not known in general. Furthermore, the excitations formed by modifying this state have remarkable properties. As the abstract to Laughlin’s paper puts it:\n\nThis Letter presents variational ground-state and excited-state wave functions which describe the condensation of a two-dimensional electron gas into a new state of matter.\n\nHowever, we’ll see that the \\(m=1\\) an \\(m&gt;1\\) cases do have some common features. First, we should try and explain where these wavefunctions came from. Conceptually, the simplest case to discuss is that of bosons interacting via the repulsive potential \\[\nH_{\\text{int}} = g\\sum_{j&lt;k}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_k),\\qquad g&gt;0\n\\tag{7}\\] The Laughlin state Equation 6 with \\(m=2\\) has zero interaction energy. In fact, any state with zero interaction energy must have \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) as a factor. But if a wavefunction has a higher degree, then in the presence of the potential Equation 3 it will have a higher energy than \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\). Thus \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) is the ground state.\nLaughlin argued that for electrons with Coulomb interaction \\(\\Psi_{m}(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) with \\(m\\) odd is a good variational wavefunction. The fact that \\((z_j-z_k)\\) appears in a power higher than one means that the particles tend to stay away from each other more than in the \\(m=1\\) state, thus lowering their interaction.\nTo get more precise information about the behaviour of wavefunctions, Laughlin introduced a powerful analogy between the probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi_m(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\rvert^2\\) of the particles, and the Boltzmann distribution of particles in a classical 2D plasma. Before doing that, it’s useful to actually ‘look’ at a typical configuration of particles.\n\n\n\nComparison of Monte Carlo samples from an uncorrelated (uniform) distrubution of points (left) vs. the Laughlin probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi_3(z_1,\\ldots z_N)\\rvert^2\\) (right).\n\n\nThe striking feature of the right hand picture is the uniformity of the particle distribution, in contrast with the sample of uncorrelated particles on the left. The plasma analogy helps us to understand this, and a lot more.",

This observation is Laughlin’s plasma analogy. Do bear in mind that we are not talking about physical electrostatic fields – this is a mathematical identification of two probability distributions.\nOf course, we still have to analyze the statistical mechanical problem, which is hard to do exactly. Since we are interested in the large \\(N\\) limit, we can introduce a continuum charge density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) and write the electrostatic energy as a functional of \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) as \\[\n\\beta V[\\rho] = -m\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}\\, d^2\\mathbf{r}'\\, \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|\\rho(\\mathbf{r}') + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}\\, \\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|^2\\rho(\\mathbf{r}).\\\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that minimizing the energy with respect to \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) – corresponding to finding the most likely configuration – leads to the condition \\[\n-2m\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}'\\, \\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|\\rho(\\mathbf{r}') + \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|^2 = 0.\n\\]\nShow that applying \\(\\nabla^2\\) to both sides gives \\[\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi m}.\n\\]\n\n\nOn the basis of this approximation, we conclude that the density is fixed at \\(1/m\\) of the value we found for the \\(m=1\\) case, which seems reasonable. The result applies where the density is non-zero, so we get a uniform droplet as before, this time of radius \\(\\sqrt{2Nm}\\). \\(1/m\\) is called the filling fraction of the state.\nAlthough we ignored the effect of summing over all configuration of the particles in the partition function (i.e. we ignored the contribution of entropy to the free energy), it turns out that this effect can be ignored in the large \\(N\\) limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nOne odd thing about the above calculation is that if the charge density is uniform, how does the droplet know where to sit? The location of the origin is obviously dictated by the minimum of the quadratic term in the energy, but we could have located that anywhere in the plane and still had a uniform charge density. Cast your mind back to the old problem of a mass undergoing simple harmonic motion through a hole in the earth…\n\n\n\n\n\nA Laughlin Laughlin state",

The concept of a quasiparticle is one that we’ll meet repeatedly in this course. It describes a particle-like excitation of a many body system. Phonons – quantized lattice vibrations – are a kind of quasiparticle that you will have met before. In quantum field theory, particles themselves are described as quantized excitations of a system – fields that pervade spacetime – so at a formal level there is little difference between the particles of particle physics and the quasiparticles of condensed matter physics. The physical difference is that in the latter case we know what the background medium is made of!\nLet’s see how the plasma picture is modified by the introduction of the quasihole. The electrostatic energy is now \\[\n\\begin{align}\nV(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_N)=&-\\frac{q^2}{2\\pi m}\\sum_j \\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{R}\\right|-\\frac{q^2}{2\\pi} \\sum_{j&lt;k}\\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_k\\right|\\\\\n&+ \\frac{\\rho q_0}{4}\\sum_j \\left|\\mathbf{r}_j\\right|^2.\n\\end{align}\n\\] This is interpreted as the introduction of a charge \\(q/m\\) at point \\(\\mathbf{R} = (X, Y)\\), where \\(Z=X+iY\\).

The red dot is a quasihole: in fact for clarity it’s 20 quasiholes with an overall charge of \\(-20/m\\).\n\n\nThis means that the normalization integral is approximated by the Boltzmann weight corresponding to the interaction of this fractional charge with the background charge density \\[\n\\int \\prod_{j=1}^N d^2z_j\\,\\left|\\Psi_\\text{hole}(z_1,\\ldots, z_N|Z)\\right|^2 \\sim\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2m}\\left|Z\\right|^2\\right),\n\\]",

    "section": "1 Models of Matter",
    "text": "1 Models of Matter\nIt’s important to realise that in general simple models are neither tractable, nor display simple behaviour! To take an example: all students of physics are familiar with the Ising model of magnetism, which caricatures a lattice of magnetic ions and their complex interactions. The Ising model is defined in terms of an energy function\n\\[\nH = J\\sum_{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle} \\sigma_j \\sigma_k,\n\\label{spin_ising}\n\\]\nwhere the ‘spin’ variables \\(\\sigma_j\\) take the values \\(\\pm 1\\). The notation \\({\\langle j\\,k\\rangle}\\) indicates that the sum is over all nearest neighbour pairs on some (e.g. cubic) lattice. A negative coupling \\(J&lt;0\\) tends to promote alignment of the spins.\nThe calculation of the partition function of the Ising model, and hence of its thermodynamic behaviour, is simple in 1D, extremely hard in 2D, and – as far as we know – impossible in the most interesting case of three dimensions. As well as being intractable, it is also highly unrealistic. The complexity of the magnetic atom, consisting of tens of electrons, is reduced to a single variable describing the spin only, which is not even treated quantum mechanically. Why on earth should we care?\nThe point is that the Ising model is a minimal working example. It is designed with the minimal set of ingredients necessary to demonstrate the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. The puzzle it seeks to explain is: how do a large number of microscopic ‘magnets’ (the spins), undergoing thermal fluctuations that are constantly seeking to randomize their direction, decide to develop a macroscopic magnetization in a particular direction? Why does the magnetization appear abruptly at the the Curie temperature, rather than gradually? Obviously the spins cannot be independent. The fact that the Ising model has a magnetic transition shows us that a nearest neighbour coupling is enough.\nThat we can cook up such minimal models and analyze them, even if we can’t solve them exactly, gives us confidence that whether we are talking about Iron, Nickel, or Cobalt, the essence of the magnetic transition is the same. By understanding something about the Ising model, we can say we have understood something about magnetism in general.\nThis certainly doesn’t mean the end of story, of course. Firstly, one can try to move towards a more realistic description of ferromagnetism. What is the microscopic origin and size of the coupling? Why does Cobalt have a higher Curie temperature than Nickel? How does the magnetism interact with other properties of the metal? These are all valid questions beyond our minimal working example.\nSecondly, one can ask whether, with similar models, one can describe qualitatively different phenomena. If \\(J&gt;0\\) do the spins anti-align at some transition? What if we change the lattice? Make it disordered? Let \\(\\sigma_j\\) be a vector instead of a scalar? Make it truly quantum?\nThis course pursues this second line of investigation. We will look at the simplest models decribing interacting bosons, fermions, and spins, and try to describe the properties of the states of matter that they form. These states of matter – magnets, metals, superconductors – have real world counterparts, and by studying their toy versions we learn what makes them tick. This strategy of introducing and analyzing new models is one of the ways in which theorists try to learn what states of matter may exist, and under what conditions.",

    "section": "1 Bosons and Fermions",
    "text": "1 Bosons and Fermions\nAn \\(N\\) particle quantum system is described by a wavefunction of \\(N\\) arguments \\(\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_N)\\). The starting point of many body quantum mechanics is that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems of indistinguishable particles are described by totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric wavefunctions.\n\n\n\nJust to be clear, totally symmetric means the wavefunction is unchanged by exchanging any two coordinates, whereas totally antisymmetric means that it changes sign.\nA good fraction of this course is devoted to exploring the ramifications of this fact. Perhaps we should therefore give a very quick summary of why it appears to be true.\nThe first question is: what are indistinguishable particles? I’ll give a theorist’s answer. Indistinguishable particles are those described by Hamiltonians that are invariant under permuting the particle’s labels. Thus the sum of single particle Hamiltonians\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m}+V(\\mathbf{r_i})\\right]\n\\]\n[did you remember that \\(\\hbar=1\\)?] describes indistinguishable particles while\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m_i}+V(\\mathbf{r_i})\\right]\n\\]\ndoes not, on account of the masses being all different. Any time we have a symmetry operation that commutes with the Hamiltonian, the eigenstates of that symmetry are preserved by time evolution with that Hamiltonian. Thus a symmetric potential \\(V(x)=V(-x)\\) commutes with the parity operation \\(x\\to -x\\), so the eigenstates of this operation – the even and odd wavefunctions – are preserved by time evolution.\nThe Hamiltonian of indistinguishable particles commutes with every operator of particle exchange, defined by \\[\nP_{ij}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_i,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_j,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_j,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_i,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N).\n\\]\nThese operators satisfy \\(P_{ij}^2=\\mathbb{1}\\), so their eigenvalues are \\(\\pm 1\\), corresponding to states that are either symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange. The only simultaneous eigenstates of all particle exchange operations (note that different exchanges don’t commute if they involve the same particle) are the totally symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions. Thus these properties are preserved by time evolution. It’s always been this way.\nWe classify particles into symmetric bosons and antisymmetric fermions, named for Bose and Fermi respectively (the whimsical terminology is Dirac’s). The distinction works equally well for composite particles, provide we ignore the internal degrees of freedom and discuss only the center of mass coordinate. \nAll matter in the universe is made up of fermions: electrons, quarks, etc., but you can easily convince yourself that an even number of fermions make a composite boson (e.g. a \\(^4\\)He atom with two electrons, two neutrons and two protons) and an odd number make a composite fermion (\\(^3\\)He has one fewer neutron, which in turn is made up of 3 quarks).\n\n1.1 Two Particles\nA pair of particles is described by a wavefunction \\(\\Psi(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\). If we are dealing with distinguishable particles, the wavefunction of a pair of particles in states \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_1}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_2}\\rangle\\) would be\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAccounting for indistinguishability, we have either\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)]\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwith the upper sign for bosons and the lower for fermions (The \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\) yields a normalized wavefunction if \\(\\varphi_{1,2}(\\mathbf{r})\\) are orthonormal.). Note in particular that when \\(\\varphi_1=\\varphi_2\\) the fermion wavefunction vanishes. This illustrates the Pauli exclusion principle, that no two identical fermions can be in the same quantum state. There is no such restriction for bosons.\nClassically, if you had a function \\(\\rho_{1}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\) describing the probability density of finding particle \\(1\\) at position \\(\\mathbf{r}_1\\), and the corresponding quantity for an independent particle \\(2\\), you would have no hesitation in concluding that the joint distribution is\n\\[\n\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\label{eq:classicaljoint}\n\\]\nThis also follows from taking the square modulus of Equation 1. The result implied by the wavefunction Equation 2 is \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)+\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\right] \\\\\n&\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\varphi^{}_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^*_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^{}_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^*_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)+\\varphi^{}_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^*_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^{}_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^*_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn particular, \\(\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}) = 0\\) for fermions, and \\(\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}) = 2\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r})\\) for bosons. The first result is natural from the standpoint of the exclusion principle, while the second is perhaps more surprising. This shows that, because probabilities arise from the squares of amplitudes, identical particles in quantum mechanics are never truly independent.\nOne dramatic illustration of this deviation from our classical intuition is provided by the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect in quantum optics. In simplified terms, we imagine wavepackets describing two photons (bosons) approaching a 50:50 beam splitter from either side. Because of the unitarity of scattering, the two photons end up in orthogonal states. For example, \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle+ \\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\right)\\\\\\\\\n\\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle- \\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nIf we start in \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_\\text{L}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\text{R}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_\\text{R}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\text{L}(\\mathbf{r}_2)]\n\\] What state do we end up in?\n\n\n\n\n\nFour possible outcomes after the passage of two bosons through a beam splitter.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Product States\nThe Hamiltonian of a system of \\(N\\) identical noninteracting particles is a sum of \\(N\\) identical single particle Hamiltonians, that is, with each term acting on a different particle coordinate\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m}+V(\\mathbf{r}_i)\\right]\n\\label{quantum_statistics_SPHamiltonian}\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the particle mass, and \\(V(\\mathbf{r})\\) is a potential experienced by the particles.\nLet’s denote the eigenstates of the single particle Hamiltonian by \\(\\{\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\}\\) , and the corresponding eigenenergies by \\(\\{E_\\alpha\\}\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a shorthand for whatever quantum numbers are used to label the states.\nA set of labels \\(\\{\\alpha_{i}\\}\\) \\(i=1,2,\\ldots N\\) tells us the state of each of the particles. Thus we can write an eigenstatof \\(N\\) distinguishable particles with energy \\(E=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{\\alpha_{i}}\\) as\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\Psi_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots \\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle=\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}})\n\\tag{3}\\]\n(We will frequently switch between the wavefunction \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{x})\\) and bra-ket notation \\(\\lvert{\\varphi}\\rangle\\). In the latter notation the product wavefunction in Equation 1 is written \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{1}}\\rangle\\lvert{\\varphi_{2}}\\rangle\\))\nSuch states are called product states. A general state will be expressed as a superposition of product states: they are special states which provide a frequently convenient basis.\nAs we’ve just discussed, however, we should really be dealing with a totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric wavefunction, depending on whether our identical particles are bosons or fermions. To write these down we introduce the operators of symmetrization and antisymmetrization\n\\[\n\\mathcal{S}=\\frac{1}{N!}\\sum_{\\pi} P_\\pi, \\qquad \\mathcal{A}=\\frac{1}{N!}\\sum_{\\pi} \\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)P_\\pi\n\\tag{4}\\]\nHere’s the definition of the various quantities in Equation 4:\n\nThe sums are over all \\(N!\\) permutations \\(\\pi\\) of \\(N\\) objects. One way to think of a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is as a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) between the set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots N\\}\\) and itself, so that 1 is mapped to \\(\\pi(1)\\), etc..\n\\(P_\\pi\\) denotes the corresponding permutation operator \\[\nP_\\pi \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(1)}, \\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(2)},\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(N)})\n\\]\n\\(\\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)\\) is the signature of the permutation, equal to \\(+1\\) for permutations involving an even number of exchanges (transpositions), and \\(-1\\) for an odd number. Note that although the same permutation can be accomplished with many different sets of transpositions, the number of transpositions is either always odd or always even.\n\nEquation 4 allows us to write the totally symmetric and totally antisymmetric versions of Equation 3 as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lvert{\\Psi^{S}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle&=\\sqrt{\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\mathcal{S}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}}) \\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N!\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\sum_\\pi\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(1)}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(2)}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(N)}})\\\\\n\\lvert{\\Psi^{A}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle&=\\sqrt{N!}\\mathcal{A}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}})\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N!}}\\sum_\\pi \\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(1)}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(2)}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(N)}}),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nwhere the occupation numbers \\(\\{N_{\\alpha}\\}\\) in the boson case give the number of particles in state \\(\\alpha\\). These normalization factors yield normalized wavefunctions if the single particle state \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\) are orthonormal (as the eigenstates of the single particle Hamiltonian are). In the fermion case each \\(N_{\\alpha}\\) is either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) so the prefactor simplifies. Since the order of the \\(\\alpha\\) indices is irrelevant in the boson case, and amounts only to a sign in the fermion case, states based on a given set of single particle states are more efficiently labeled by the occupation numbers. In terms of these numbers the total energy is\n\\[\n\\label{quantum_statistics_TotalEnergy}\nE=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{\\alpha_{i}}=\\sum_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha} E_{\\alpha}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nVerify that the normalization factors in Equation 5 are correct.\n\n\nA more formal way of putting things is as follows. We first consider the space spanned by states of the form Equation 3. Then we introduce the operators \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), noting that \\(\\mathcal{S}^{2}=\\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}^{2}=\\mathcal{A}\\). In other words, there’s no point symmetrizing or antisymmetrizing more than once (we say that the operators are idempotent). Any eigenvalue of one of these operators is therefore either one or zero. The states with \\(\\mathcal{S}=1\\) are the symmetric states, and those with \\(\\mathcal{A}=1\\) are antisymmetric. You can easily convince yourself that if a state has one of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) or \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) equal to one, the other is zero. This defines symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, consisting of the admissible boson and fermion wavefunctions.\nNote that the fermion wavefunction takes the form of a Slater determinant (though it appears first in {% cite dirac1926 %}).\n\\[\n   \\lvert{\\Psi^{A}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}}) & \\cdots & \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}}) \\\\\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n   \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}})\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe vanishing of a determinant when two rows or two columns are identical means that the wavefunction is zero if two particle coordinates coincide (\\(\\mathbf{r}_{i}=\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\)), or if two particles occupy the same state (\\(\\alpha_{i}=\\alpha_{j}\\)).",

    "text": "2 The 1D Fermi Gas\nLet’s consider perhaps the simplest many particle system one can think of: noninteracting particles on a ring. If the ring has circumference \\(L\\), the single particle eigenstates are \\[\n    \\label{quantum_statistics_spstates}\n    \\varphi_{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}}\\exp\\left(ik_n x\\right),\n\\]\nwith \\(k_n=\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\\), \\(n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\). The corresponding energies are \\(E_{n}=\\frac{k_n^2}{2m}\\).\n\n2.1 Ground State\nLet’s find the \\(N\\) particle ground state. For bosons every particle is in the state \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{0}}\\rangle\\) with zero energy: \\(N_{0}=N\\). Thus\n\\[\n    \\Psi^{S}_0(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots x_{N})=\\frac{1}{L^{N/2}}\n\\]\nThat was easy! The fermion case is harder.\nSince the occupation of each level is at most one, the lowest energy is obtained by filling each level with one particle, starting at the bottom. If we have an odd number of particles, this means filling the levels with \\(n=-(N-1)/2, -(N-3)/2,\\ldots, -1, 0, 1 \\ldots (N-1)/2\\) (for an even number of particles we have to decide whether to put the last particle at \\(n=\\pm N/2\\)). Introducing the complex variables\n\\[\nz_{i}=\\exp(2 \\pi i x_{i}/L),\n\\]\nthe Slater determinant Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n    \\Psi^A_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)=\\begin{vmatrix}\n    z_{1}^{-(N-1)/2} &  z_{2}^{-(N-1)/2} & \\cdots & z_{N}^{-(N-1)/2} \\\\\n    z_{1}^{-(N-3)/2} &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n    \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n    z_{1}^{(N-1)/2} &  \\cdots & \\cdots & z_{N}^{(N-1)/2}\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n\\tag{7}\\]\nLet’s evaluate this complicated looking expression in a simple case. With three particles we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Psi^A_0(x_1,x_2,x_3)&=\\begin{vmatrix}\n        z_{1}^{-1} & z_{2}^{-1} & z_{3}^{-1} \\\\\n        1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n        z_{1} & z_{2} & z_{3}\n    \\end{vmatrix} = \\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}-\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{1}}+\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{1}}-\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{3}}+\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{3}}-\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{2}}\\nonumber\\\\\n    &=\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{1}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{3}}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{1}}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{3}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{2}}}\\right)  \\nonumber\\\\\n    &\\propto \\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{1}-x_{2}]}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{3}-x_{1}]}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{2}-x_{3}]}{L}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nThe vanishing of the wavefunction when \\(x_{i}=x_{j}\\) is consistent with the Pauli principle. You should check that additionally it is periodic and totally antisymmetric.\nEquation 8 generalizes for any (odd) \\(N\\) so that the ground state Slater determinant Equation 7 is proportional to\n\\[\n\\Psi^A_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)\\propto\\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi[x_{i}-x_{j}]}{L}\\right).\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow this using the Vandermonde determinant \\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\\nz_{1} &  z_{2} & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\nz_{1}^{2} & z_{2}^{2} & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\nz_{1}^{N-1} &  z_{2}^{N-1} & \\cdots & z_{N}^{N-1}\n\\end{vmatrix}=\\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N}(z_{j}-z_{i})\n\\] which can be proved in a variety of ways. Proving directly that Equation 9 is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not easy, but can be accomplished using the identity\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{2nd_quant_cotident}\n\\cot(x-y)\\cot(y-z)+\\cot(y-z)\\cot(z-x)+\\cot(z-x)\\cot(x-y)=1. \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nCheck carefully that Equation 9 is periodic and totally antisymmetric.\n\n\nLet’s take the opportunity to introduce some terminology. The wavevector of the last fermion added is called the Fermi wavevector and denoted \\(k_\\text{F}\\). In this case \\(k_\\text{F}=\\frac{(N-1)\\pi}{L}\\). Its energy \\(E_{F}=\\frac{k_\\text{F}^{2}}{2m}\\) is the Fermi energy.\n\n\n2.2 Density; Density Matrix; Pair Distribution\nHaving a many particle wave function is one thing, but what to do with it? Bear in mind that Equation 9 is just about the simplest fermion state you can imagine, but it’s not immediately clear what it is telling us.\n\\(\\vert\\Psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2\\) is the probability distribution of the positions of the particles. If we were able to take a photograph of the positions of the particles at an instant in time, this would correspond to taking a sample from the probability distribution. In terms of the complex variables \\(z_j\\), it would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A sample from the probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi^A_0(z_1,\\ldots,z_N)\\rvert^2\\) for 50 particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Uniformly distributed points on the circle described by \\(\\vert\\Psi^{S}_0(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots x_{N})\\rvert^2\\). The particle positions are uncorrelated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of particle positions for noninteracting fermion and boson ground states.\n\n\n\nSince \\(\\lvert\\Psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2\\) is the probability distribution of the positions of the particles, we can use it to find the marginal probability distributions for any subset of the particles. Of course, since the particles are identical, it doesn’t matter which ones we choose, just the number.\nThe one particle distribution is related to the average density of particles, given by \\[\n\\rho_1(x_1) = N \\int dx_2\\ldots dx_N \\,\\lvert\\Psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2.\n\\tag{10}\\] Note that although I use the symbol \\(\\rho\\), density is always going to be number density (not the mass density).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nCan you explain why this is the density? Think about the simpler case of two particles, with discrete locations. Why is the expected number of particles at position \\(x\\) \\[\nN_x = \\sum_y \\left[P(x,y) + P(y,x)\\right]?\n\\]\nWhat if we have more particles?\n\n\nNormalization of the wavefunction then implies \\[\n\\int dx\\, \\rho_1(x) = N.\n\\] In a translationally invariant system like the fermion gas on a ring we expect the average density to be constant.\nWe can regard Equation 10 as an expectation of a density operator \\[\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_j \\delta(x-x_j),\n\\tag{11}\\] so that \\(\\rho_1(x) = \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\rho(x) \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\\).\nThe single particle density matrix is a generalization of the expectation of the density, and is defined as (we’ll see shortly why this is a useful quantity) \\[\ng(x,y) \\equiv N\\int dx_2\\ldots dx_N \\,\\Psi^{}(x,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\Psi^{*}(y,x_2,\\ldots,x_N).\n\\tag{12}\\] Note that \\(g(x,x) = \\rho_1(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the average number of particles in a single particle state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) is \\[\n\\bar N_\\psi = \\int dx dy\\, \\psi^*(x)g(x,y)\\psi(y).\n\\tag{13}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nStarting from the Slater determinant Equation 7 (i.e. not from the explicit form Equation 9), show that \\(g(x,y)\\) for the ground state of the Fermi gas is \\[\ng(x,y) = \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{|k|&lt;k_\\text{F}} e^{ik(x-y)} = \\int_{k_\\text{F}}^{k_\\text{F}} \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} e^{ik(x-y)} = n \\frac{\\sin \\left[k_\\text{F}(x-y)\\right]}{k_\\text{F}(x-y)}\n\\] where \\(n \\equiv \\frac{k_\\text{F}}{\\pi}\\) is the average density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nFind the average number of particles in a momentum state \\(\\lvert{k}\\rangle\\) using Equation 13 \\[\n\\bar N_k = \\begin{cases}\n1 & |k|\\leq k_\\text{F} \\\\\n0 & |k|&gt;k_\\text{F}\n\\end{cases}.\n\\tag{14}\\] Note that in a translationally invariant system \\(g(x,y)=g(x-y)\\), and is the Fourier transform of \\(\\bar N_k\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo understand the origin of the name single particle density matrix, recall that the density matrix \\(\\varrho\\) describes a mixed state of a quantum system, and is the appropriate description when the quantum state is not known. \\(\\varrho\\) is a positive definite hermitian operator satisfying \\(\\tr \\varrho =1\\). Its spectral resolution \\[\n\\varrho = \\sum_\\alpha p_\\alpha \\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rvert,\n\\] can be thought of as a statistical mixture of different quantum states \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\) with probabilities \\(p_\\alpha\\).\nOne natural way in which density matrices arise from pure states is as follows. The Hilbert space of a composite system consists of a tensor product of two or more components \\(\\mathcal{H}_{AB} = \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B\\). Starting from the density matrix corresponding to a pure state, we can obtain a density matrix for the component \\(A\\) alone by ‘tracing out’ the \\(B\\) subsystem. \\[\n\\varrho_A = \\tr_B \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert,\\quad \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H}_{AB}.\n\\] The probability for system \\(A\\) to be in state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H}_A\\) is \\[\nP_\\psi = \\langle{\\psi}\\rvert\\varrho\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle.\n\\] Thus you can think of the single particle density matrix Equation 12 as arising from tracing out \\(N-1\\) particles from an \\(N\\)-particle system.\nWe can also consider marginal probability distribution of a pair of particles, and define the pair distribution function \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = N(N-1) \\int dx_3\\ldots dx_N \\,\\left|\\Psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\right|^2.\n\\] The prefactor is to account for all pairs of particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nStarting from the Slater determinant Equation 7, show that \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = n^2\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sin\\left[k_\\text{F}(x_1-x_2)\\right]}{k_\\text{F}(x_1-x_2)}\\right)^2\\right].\n\\] This vanishes at \\(x_1=x_2\\), consistent with the Pauli principle.\n\n\nA natural question: \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) \\overset{?}{=} \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x_1)\\rho(x_2)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle.\n\\] Almost. Looking back at Equation 11, we see that the product of two density operators will contain terms involving the same particle, which are absent from \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the correct relationship is \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x_1)\\rho(x_2)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle - \\rho_1(x_1)\\delta(x_1-x_2).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Impenetrable Bose Gas\nThere’s a bit more mileage in the 1D Fermi gas yet. Consider the following Hamiltonian \\[\nH = -\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_j \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_j^2} + \\overbrace{c\\sum_{j&lt;k}\\delta(x_j-x_k)}^{\\equiv H_\\text{int}}.\n\\label{many_LL}\n\\] The second term represents an interaction between pairs of particles. Of course, this model is rather special, as (1) it’s 1D and (2) the interaction potential is a \\(\\delta\\)-function. Nevertheless, it represents a huge step up in difficulty from the noninteracting examples we’ve discussed so far. At least, it does for bosons. For fermions, the wavefunctions vanish at coincident points, and so the interaction has no effect at all!\nFor bosons, it happens that the Hamiltonian can still be solved exactly. For now, however, we’ll concern ourselves only with the limit of infinite interaction: \\(c\\to \\infty\\), sometimes called the impenetrable limit. In this case, the eigenenergies coincide with those of the free fermion problem, and the eigenstates are just the modulus of the corresponding fermion eigenstate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nJust like that, we’ve solved our first interacting many body system (and with infinite coupling, no less)!\nThus the ground state on the ring has the form \\[\n\\Psi_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N) = \\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi[x_{i}-x_{j}]}{L}\\right)\\right|.\n\\]\nIt’s not hard to see why this works. For a state to have a finite energy, the wavefunction must vanish whenever two coordinates coincide. This is because the interation energy has the expectation value \\[\n\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H_\\text{int} \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle=cN(N-1)\\int dx_1\\cdots dx_{N-1}\\left|\n\\Psi(x_1,x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N\\right|^2\n\\] But we already have a complete set of eigenstates that obey this condition, namely the free fermion Slater determinants. It remains to make them symmetric functions by taking the modulus.\nThis mapping is quite powerful, and allows us to calculate any observable of the impenetrable Bose gas in terms of free fermions as long as that observable is insensitive to taking the modulus of the wavefunction. Thus the average density \\(\\rho_1(x)\\) and pair distribution \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\) of the previous section can be found in this way, but the single particle density matrix \\(g(x,y)\\) cannot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow this explicitly.\n\n\nThis means that the momentum distribution is not given by Equation 14. Finding \\(g(x,y)\\) for the impenetrable Bose gas is in fact really hard. We’ll see in a later lecture how to obtain some of its important features.",
