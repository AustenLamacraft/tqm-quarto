    "section": "1 Models of Matter",
    "text": "1 Models of Matter\nIt’s important to realise that in general simple models are neither tractable, nor display simple behaviour! To take an example: all students of physics are familiar with the Ising model of magnetism, which caricatures a lattice of magnetic ions and their complex interactions. The Ising model is defined in terms of an energy function\n\\[\nH = J\\sum_{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle} \\sigma_j \\sigma_k,\n\\label{spin_ising}\n\\]\nwhere the ‘spin’ variables \\(\\sigma_j\\) take the values \\(\\pm 1\\). The notation \\({\\langle j\\,k\\rangle}\\) indicates that the sum is over all nearest neighbour pairs on some (e.g. cubic) lattice. A negative coupling \\(J&lt;0\\) tends to promote alignment of the spins.\nThe calculation of the partition function of the Ising model, and hence of its thermodynamic behaviour, is simple in 1D, extremely hard in 2D, and – as far as we know – impossible in the most interesting case of three dimensions. As well as being intractable, it is also highly unrealistic. The complexity of the magnetic atom, consisting of tens of electrons, is reduced to a single variable describing the spin only, which is not even treated quantum mechanically. Why on earth should we care?\nThe point is that the Ising model is a minimal working example. It is designed with the minimal set of ingredients necessary to demonstrate the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. The puzzle it seeks to explain is: how do a large number of microscopic ‘magnets’ (the spins), undergoing thermal fluctuations that are constantly seeking to randomize their direction, decide to develop a macroscopic magnetization in a particular direction? Why does the magnetization appear abruptly at the the Curie temperature, rather than gradually? Obviously the spins cannot be independent. The fact that the Ising model has a magnetic transition shows us that a nearest neighbour coupling is enough.\nThat we can cook up such minimal models and analyze them, even if we can’t solve them exactly, gives us confidence that whether we are talking about Iron, Nickel, or Cobalt, the essence of the magnetic transition is the same. By understanding something about the Ising model, we can say we have understood something about magnetism in general.\nThis certainly doesn’t mean the end of story, of course. Firstly, one can try to move towards a more realistic description of ferromagnetism. What is the microscopic origin and size of the coupling? Why does Cobalt have a higher Curie temperature than Nickel? How does the magnetism interact with other properties of the metal? These are all valid questions beyond our minimal working example.\nSecondly, one can ask whether, with similar models, one can describe qualitatively different phenomena. If \\(J&gt;0\\) do the spins anti-align at some transition? What if we change the lattice? Make it disordered? Let \\(\\sigma_j\\) be a vector instead of a scalar? Make it truly quantum?\nThis course pursues this second line of investigation. We will look at the simplest models decribing interacting bosons, fermions, and spins, and try to describe the properties of the states of matter that they form. These states of matter – magnets, metals, superconductors – have real world counterparts, and by studying their toy versions we learn what makes them tick. This strategy of introducing and analyzing new models is one of the ways in which theorists try to learn what states of matter may exist, and under what conditions.",

    "text": "\\[\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\tr}{tr}\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\E}{\\mathbb{E}}\n\\]\nThe Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is one of the most remarkable phenomena in all of condensed matter physics. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, charged particles confined to move in the plane can form a series of new states of matter with bizarre properties. Fortunately, our understanding of this menagerie is based almost entirely on many body wavefunctions of a rather simple form.\nThe quantum Hall effect refers to quantization of the Hall conductivity \\(G_{xy}= \\frac{I_x}{V_y}\\) into integer multiples of the conductance quantum \\(e^2/h\\). This phenomenon is obvserved in two dimensional electon gases at low temperatures in a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. Some years after its discovery, the fractional quantum Hall effect was observed, with \\(G_{xy} = \\nu e^2/h\\), with \\(\\nu\\) taking simple fractional values \\(\\nu=1/3, 2/5\\), etc..\nThese fractional values are only the tip of an iceberg of remarkable phenomena, indicating that the electrons are reorganizing into a bewildering variety of exotic states of matter, characterized by excitations with fractional charge and statistics outside the boson / fermion dichotomy discussed earlier. Even more surprisingly, our understanding of these phases rests largely on guessing the right wavefunction to describe these strongly interacting systems. How is such a thing possible? As we’ll see below, the wavefunction is in fact strongly constrained by the presence of the magnetic field.\nReading: Girvin (2002), Stone (1992).",

    "text": "1 Landau Levels\nThe first task is to discuss the states of a single particle of charge \\(q\\) in 2D in a perpendicular magnetic field.

We choose symmetric gauge\n\\[\nA_x = -\\frac{1}{2} B y,\\quad A_y = \\frac{1}{2} B x.\n\\]\nNext, we introduce complex coordinates\n\\[\nz = x + i y \\quad \\bar z  = x - iy,\n\\]\n(The notation \\(\\bar z\\) for the complex conjugate is neater when we need to write \\(\\partial_{\\bar z}\\) together with the derivatives\n\\[\n\\partial_z = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_x - i\\partial_y\\right) \\quad \\partial_{\\bar z} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_x + i\\partial_y\\right).\n\\]\nWe can rewrite the Hamiltonian Equation 1 as\n\\[\nH = -\\frac{2}{m}\\left(\\partial_z -\\frac{qB \\bar z}{4}\\right)\\left(\\partial_{\\bar z} +\\frac{qB z}{4}\\right) + \\frac{\\omega_c}{2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega_c = \\frac{qB}{m}\\) is the cyclotron frequency. States that satisfy\n\\[\n\\left(\\partial_{\\bar z} +\\frac{qB z}{4}\\right)\\psi(z,\\bar z) = 0\n\\]\ntherefore have energy \\(\\omega_c/2\\) and belong to the lowest Landau level (LLL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that these states have the form \\[\n\\psi(z,\\bar z) = f(z) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{qB}{4}\\left|z\\right|^2\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(f(z)\\) is an arbitrary analytic function. Note that we are assuming that \\(qB&gt;0\\). For \\(qB&lt;0\\) \\(z\\) and \\(\\bar z\\) are exchanged and the LLL states are antianaltyic.\n\n\nYou may recall that the Landau levels are highly degenerate. In symmetric gauge this degeneracy may be seen to result from our freedom to choose the coefficients of this power series, and yet the states are a very special subclass of the possible 2D wavefunctions \\(\\psi(z,\\bar z)\\).\nIt’s often convenient to work with the analytic part \\(f(z)\\) of the wavefunction, with the understanding that the inner product \\(\\langle{f_1}\\rvert f_2\\rangle\\) is \\[\n\\label{eq:fb}\n\\langle{f_1}\\rvert f_2\\rangle = \\int \\frac{d^2z}{2\\pi} \\overline{f_1(z)}f_2(z) \\exp\\left(-\\left|z\\right|^2/2\\right),\n\\] (Note that \\(d^2z=dx dy\\): our wavefunctions live in 2D) where we have chosen units in which the magnetic length \\(\\ell \\equiv (qB)^{-1/2}\\) is one. The physical meaning of this length scale is that an area \\(2\\pi \\ell^2\\) contains one flux quantum \\(\\Phi_0 = h/q=2\\pi/q\\).\nA possible orthonormal basis is \\[\nf_n(z) = \\frac{z^n}{\\sqrt{2^n n!}}.\n\\]\nThe Hilbert space of analytic functions is known as Segal–Bargmann–Fock space.",

    "text": "2 Filled LLL of Fermions\nLet’s imagine filling the LLL with fermions. As it stands, there’s no principle to suggest how we do this, as all the states are degenerate. We can lift that degeneracy by adding a rotationally symmetric harmonic potential \\[\nV_\\text{harm}(x,y) = \\frac{v}{2}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right) = \\frac{v}{2}\\left|z\\right|^2.\n\\tag{2}\\] When this potential acts on a state in the LLL, the result is not a LLL state because of the appearance of \\(\\bar z\\) in \\(V\\). Let’s suppose that the cyclotron energy \\(\\omega_c\\) that gives the spacing between Landau levels is the largest energy scale in the problem.

The ground state of noninteracting fermions therefore just amounts to filling the states \\(\\lvert{f_n}\\rangle\\) from the bottom. Identical arguments to those used in discussing the Fermi gas on the ring then tell us that the ground state wavefunction of \\(N\\) fermions is \\[\n\\Psi(z_1,\\ldots, z_N) = \\prod_{j&lt;k}^N (z_j-z_k) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{j=1}^N\\left|z_j\\right|^2\\right)\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the density is \\[\n\\rho_1(z,\\bar z) = \\frac{e^{-|z|^2/2}}{2\\pi}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\left|z\\right|^{2n}}{2^n n!} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(N,|z|^2/2)}{(N-1)!}.\n\\tag{5}\\] Here \\(\\Gamma(s,x) = \\int^\\infty_x t^{s-1}e^{-t}dt\\) is the incomplete gamma function.\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity of particles in the LLL for \\(N=100\\)\n\n\nAt small \\(\\left\\|z\\right\\|\\), we can approximate the sum in Equation 5 by extending the upper limit to \\(\\infty\\), and we have \\(\\rho_1\\to \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\).

This picture is in fact quite general: changing the confining potential would cause the droplet to deform, but the density to remain constant (on the macroscopic scale).",

    "section": "3 The Laughlin Wavefunction",
    "text": "3 The Laughlin Wavefunction\nThe theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect begins with Robert Laughlin’s famous wavefunction Laughlin (1983) generalizing Equation 4 \\[\n\\Psi_m(z_1,\\ldots, z_N) = \\prod_{j&lt;k}^N (z_j-z_k)^{m} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{j=1}^N\\left|z_j\\right|^2\\right).\n\\tag{6}\\] For this wavefunction to describe fermions, \\(m\\) must be odd. Even \\(m\\) describes bosons. I want to emphasize first that despite the superficial similarity of Equation 4 and Equation 6, they are very different beasts. While Equation 4 is an (antisymmetric) product state Equation 6 is not, and indeed its expansion in product states is not known in general. Furthermore, the excitations formed by modifying this state have remarkable properties. As the abstract to Laughlin’s paper puts it:\n\nThis Letter presents variational ground-state and excited-state wave functions which describe the condensation of a two-dimensional electron gas into a new state of matter.\n\nHowever, we’ll see that the \\(m=1\\) an \\(m&gt;1\\) cases do have some common features. First, we should try and explain where these wavefunctions came from. Conceptually, the simplest case to discuss is that of bosons interacting via the repulsive potential \\[\nH_{\\text{int}} = g\\sum_{j&lt;k}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_k),\\qquad g&gt;0\n\\tag{7}\\] The Laughlin state Equation 6 with \\(m=2\\) has zero interaction energy. In fact, any state with zero interaction energy must have \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) as a factor. But if a wavefunction has a higher degree, then in the presence of the potential Equation 3 it will have a higher energy than \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\). Thus \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) is the ground state.\nLaughlin argued that for electrons with Coulomb interaction \\(\\Psi_{m}(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) with \\(m\\) odd is a good variational wavefunction. The fact that \\((z_j-z_k)\\) appears in a power higher than one means that the particles tend to stay away from each other more than in the \\(m=1\\) state, thus lowering their interaction.\nTo get more precise information about the behaviour of wavefunctions, Laughlin introduced a powerful analogy between the probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi_m(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\rvert^2\\) of the particles, and the Boltzmann distribution of particles in a classical 2D plasma. Before doing that, it’s useful to actually ‘look’ at a typical configuration of particles.\n\n\n\nComparison of Monte Carlo samples from an uncorrelated (uniform) distrubution of points (left) vs. the Laughlin probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi_3(z_1,\\ldots z_N)\\rvert^2\\) (right).\n\n\nThe striking feature of the right hand picture is the uniformity of the particle distribution, in contrast with the sample of uncorrelated particles on the left. The plasma analogy helps us to understand this, and a lot more.",

This observation is Laughlin’s plasma analogy. Do bear in mind that we are not talking about physical electrostatic fields – this is a mathematical identification of two probability distributions.\nOf course, we still have to analyze the statistical mechanical problem, which is hard to do exactly. Since we are interested in the large \\(N\\) limit, we can introduce a continuum charge density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) and write the electrostatic energy as a functional of \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) as \\[\n\\beta V[\\rho] = -m\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}\\, d^2\\mathbf{r}'\\, \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|\\rho(\\mathbf{r}') + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}\\, \\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|^2\\rho(\\mathbf{r}).\\\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that minimizing the energy with respect to \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) – corresponding to finding the most likely configuration – leads to the condition \\[\n-2m\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}'\\, \\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|\\rho(\\mathbf{r}') + \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|^2 = 0.\n\\]\nShow that applying \\(\\nabla^2\\) to both sides gives \\[\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi m}.\n\\]\n\n\nOn the basis of this approximation, we conclude that the density is fixed at \\(1/m\\) of the value we found for the \\(m=1\\) case, which seems reasonable. The result applies where the density is non-zero, so we get a uniform droplet as before, this time of radius \\(\\sqrt{2Nm}\\). \\(1/m\\) is called the filling fraction of the state.\nAlthough we ignored the effect of summing over all configuration of the particles in the partition function (i.e. we ignored the contribution of entropy to the free energy), it turns out that this effect can be ignored in the large \\(N\\) limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nOne odd thing about the above calculation is that if the charge density is uniform, how does the droplet know where to sit? The location of the origin is obviously dictated by the minimum of the quadratic term in the energy, but we could have located that anywhere in the plane and still had a uniform charge density.

The concept of a quasiparticle is one that we’ll meet repeatedly in this course. It describes a particle-like excitation of a many body system. Phonons – quantized lattice vibrations – are a kind of quasiparticle that you will have met before. In quantum field theory, particles themselves are described as quantized excitations of a system – fields that pervade spacetime – so at a formal level there is little difference between the particles of particle physics and the quasiparticles of condensed matter physics. The physical difference is that in the latter case we know what the background medium is made of!\nLet’s see how the plasma picture is modified by the introduction of the quasihole. The electrostatic energy is now \\[\n\\begin{align}\nV(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_N)=&-\\frac{q^2}{2\\pi m}\\sum_j \\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{R}\\right|-\\frac{q^2}{2\\pi} \\sum_{j&lt;k}\\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_k\\right|\\\\\n&+ \\frac{\\rho q_0}{4}\\sum_j \\left|\\mathbf{r}_j\\right|^2.\n\\end{align}\n\\] This is interpreted as the introduction of a charge \\(q/m\\) at point \\(\\mathbf{R} = (X, Y)\\), where \\(Z=X+iY\\).

The quasiholes have fractional charge!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Monte Carlo simulation of a Laughlin state. You can change the inverse filling fraction \\(m\\). The red dot is a quasihole: in fact for clarity it’s 20 quasiholes with an overall charge of \\(-20/m\\).\n\n\nThis means that the normalization integral is approximated by the Boltzmann weight corresponding to the interaction of this fractional charge with the background charge density \\[\n\\int \\prod_{j=1}^N d^2z_j\\,\\left|\\Psi_\\text{hole}(z_1,\\ldots, z_N|Z)\\right|^2 \\sim\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2m}\\left|Z\\right|^2\\right),\n\\]",

    "text": "1 Bosons and Fermions\nAn \\(N\\) particle quantum system is described by a wavefunction of \\(N\\) arguments \\(\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_N)\\). The starting point of many body quantum mechanics is that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems of indistinguishable particles are described by totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric wavefunctions.\n\n\n\nJust to be clear, totally symmetric means the wavefunction is unchanged by exchanging any two coordinates, whereas totally antisymmetric means that it changes sign.\nA good fraction of this course is devoted to exploring the ramifications of this fact. Perhaps we should therefore give a very quick summary of why it appears to be true.\nThe first question is: what are indistinguishable particles? I’ll give a theorist’s answer. Indistinguishable particles are those described by Hamiltonians that are invariant under permuting the particle’s labels. Thus the sum of single particle Hamiltonians\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m}+V(\\mathbf{r_i})\\right]\n\\]\n[did you remember that \\(\\hbar=1\\)?] describes indistinguishable particles while\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m_i}+V(\\mathbf{r_i})\\right]\n\\]\ndoes not, on account of the masses being all different. Any time we have a symmetry operation that commutes with the Hamiltonian, the eigenstates of that symmetry are preserved by time evolution with that Hamiltonian. Thus a symmetric potential \\(V(x)=V(-x)\\) commutes with the parity operation \\(x\\to -x\\), so the eigenstates of this operation – the even and odd wavefunctions – are preserved by time evolution.\nThe Hamiltonian of indistinguishable particles commutes with every operator of particle exchange, defined by \\[\nP_{ij}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_i,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_j,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_j,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_i,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N).\n\\]\nThese operators satisfy \\(P_{ij}^2=\\mathbb{1}\\), so their eigenvalues are \\(\\pm 1\\), corresponding to states that are either symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange. The only simultaneous eigenstates of all particle exchange operations (note that different exchanges don’t commute if they involve the same particle) are the totally symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions. Thus these properties are preserved by time evolution. It’s always been this way.\nWe classify particles into symmetric bosons and antisymmetric fermions, named for Bose and Fermi respectively (the whimsical terminology is Dirac’s). The distinction works equally well for composite particles, provide we ignore the internal degrees of freedom and discuss only the center of mass coordinate. \nAll matter in the universe is made up of fermions: electrons, quarks, etc., but you can easily convince yourself that an even number of fermions make a composite boson (e.g. a \\(^4\\)He atom with two electrons, two neutrons and two protons) and an odd number make a composite fermion (\\(^3\\)He has one fewer neutron, which in turn is made up of 3 quarks).\n\n1.1 Two Particles\nA pair of particles is described by a wavefunction \\(\\Psi(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\). If we are dealing with distinguishable particles, the wavefunction of a pair of particles in states \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_1}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_2}\\rangle\\) would be\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAccounting for indistinguishability, we have either\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)]\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwith the upper sign for bosons and the lower for fermions (The \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\) yields a normalized wavefunction if \\(\\varphi_{1,2}(\\mathbf{r})\\) are orthonormal.). Note in particular that when \\(\\varphi_1=\\varphi_2\\) the fermion wavefunction vanishes. This illustrates the Pauli exclusion principle, that no two identical fermions can be in the same quantum state. There is no such restriction for bosons.\nClassically, if you had a function \\(\\rho_{1}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\) describing the probability density of finding particle \\(1\\) at position \\(\\mathbf{r}_1\\), and the corresponding quantity for an independent particle \\(2\\), you would have no hesitation in concluding that the joint distribution is\n\\[\n\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\label{eq:classicaljoint}\n\\]\nThis also follows from taking the square modulus of Equation 1. The result implied by the wavefunction Equation 2 is \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)+\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\right] \\\\\n&\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\varphi^{}_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^*_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^{}_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^*_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)+\\varphi^{}_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^*_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^{}_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^*_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn particular, \\(\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}) = 0\\) for fermions, and \\(\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}) = 2\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r})\\) for bosons. The first result is natural from the standpoint of the exclusion principle, while the second is perhaps more surprising. This shows that, because probabilities arise from the squares of amplitudes, identical particles in quantum mechanics are never truly independent.\nOne dramatic illustration of this deviation from our classical intuition is provided by the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect in quantum optics. In simplified terms, we imagine wavepackets describing two photons (bosons) approaching a 50:50 beam splitter from either side. Because of the unitarity of scattering, the two photons end up in orthogonal states. For example, \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle+ \\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\right)\\\\\\\\\n\\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle- \\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nIf we start in \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_\\text{L}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\text{R}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_\\text{R}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\text{L}(\\mathbf{r}_2)]\n\\] What state do we end up in?\n\n\n\n\n\nFour possible outcomes after the passage of two bosons through a beam splitter.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Product States\nThe Hamiltonian of a system of \\(N\\) identical noninteracting particles is a sum of \\(N\\) identical single particle Hamiltonians, that is, with each term acting on a different particle coordinate\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m}+V(\\mathbf{r}_i)\\right]\n\\label{quantum_statistics_SPHamiltonian}\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the particle mass, and \\(V(\\mathbf{r})\\) is a potential experienced by the particles.\nLet’s denote the eigenstates of the single particle Hamiltonian by \\(\\{\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\}\\) , and the corresponding eigenenergies by \\(\\{E_\\alpha\\}\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a shorthand for whatever quantum numbers are used to label the states.\nA set of labels \\(\\{\\alpha_{i}\\}\\) \\(i=1,2,\\ldots N\\) tells us the state of each of the particles.

In the latter notation the product wavefunction in Equation 1 is written \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{1}}\\rangle\\lvert{\\varphi_{2}}\\rangle\\))\nSuch states are called product states. A general state will be expressed as a superposition of product states: they are special states which provide a frequently convenient basis.\nAs we’ve just discussed, however, we should really be dealing with a totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric wavefunction, depending on whether our identical particles are bosons or fermions. To write these down we introduce the operators of symmetrization and antisymmetrization\n\\[\n\\mathcal{S}=\\frac{1}{N!}\\sum_{\\pi} P_\\pi, \\qquad \\mathcal{A}=\\frac{1}{N!}\\sum_{\\pi} \\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)P_\\pi\n\\tag{4}\\]\nHere’s the definition of the various quantities in Equation 4:\n\nThe sums are over all \\(N!\\) permutations \\(\\pi\\) of \\(N\\) objects. One way to think of a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is as a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) between the set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots N\\}\\) and itself, so that 1 is mapped to \\(\\pi(1)\\), etc..\n\\(P_\\pi\\) denotes the corresponding permutation operator \\[\nP_\\pi \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(1)}, \\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(2)},\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(N)})\n\\]\n\\(\\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)\\) is the signature of the permutation, equal to \\(+1\\) for permutations involving an even number of exchanges, and \\(-1\\) for an odd number.\n\nEquation 4 allows us to write the totally symmetric and totally antisymmetric versions of Equation 3 as \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lvert{\\Psi^{S}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle&=\\sqrt{\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\mathcal{S}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}}) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lvert{\\Psi^{A}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle&=\\sqrt{N!}\\mathcal{A}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}}),\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nwhere the occupation numbers \\(\\{N_{\\alpha}\\}\\) in the boson case give the number of particles in state \\(\\alpha\\). These normalization factors yield normalized wavefunctions if the single particle state \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\) are orthonormal (as the eigenstates of the single particle Hamiltonian are). In the fermion case each \\(N_{\\alpha}\\) is either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) so the prefactor simplifies. Since the order of the \\(\\alpha\\) indices is irrelevant in the boson case, and amounts only to a sign in the fermion case, states based on a given set of single particle states are more efficiently labeled by the occupation numbers. In terms of these numbers the total energy is\n\\[\n\\label{quantum_statistics_TotalEnergy}\nE=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{\\alpha_{i}}=\\sum_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha} E_{\\alpha}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nVerify that the normalization factors in Equation 5 are correct.\n\n\nA more formal way of putting things is as follows. We first consider the space spanned by states of the form Equation 3. Then we introduce the operators \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), noting that \\(\\mathcal{S}^{2}=\\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}^{2}=\\mathcal{A}\\). In other words, there’s no point symmetrizing or antisymmetrizing more than once (we say that the operators are idempotent). Any eigenvalue of one of these operators is therefore either one or zero. The states with \\(\\mathcal{S}=1\\) are the symmetric states, and those with \\(\\mathcal{A}=1\\) are antisymmetric. You can easily convince yourself that if a state has one of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) or \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) equal to one, the other is zero. This defines symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, consisting of the admissible boson and fermion wavefunctions.\nNote that the fermion wavefunction takes the form of a Slater determinant (though it appears first in {% cite dirac1926 %}).\n\\[\n   \\lvert{\\Psi^{A}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}}) & \\cdots & \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}}) \\\\\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n   \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}})\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe vanishing of a determinant when two rows or two columns are identical means that the wavefunction is zero if two particle coordinates coincide (\\(\\mathbf{r}_{i}=\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\)), or if two particles occupy the same state (\\(\\alpha_{i}=\\alpha_{j}\\)).",

    "text": "2 The 1D Fermi Gas\nLet’s consider perhaps the simplest many particle system one can think of: noninteracting particles on a ring. If the ring has circumference \\(L\\), the single particle eigenstates are \\[\n    \\label{quantum_statistics_spstates}\n    \\varphi_{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}}\\exp\\left(ik_n x\\right),\n\\]\nwith \\(k_n=\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\\), \\(n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\). The corresponding energies are \\(E_{n}=\\frac{k_n^2}{2m}\\).\n\n2.1 Ground State\nLet’s find the \\(N\\) particle ground state. For bosons every particle is in the state \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{0}}\\rangle\\) with zero energy: \\(N_{0}=N\\). Thus\n\\[\n    \\Psi^{S}_0(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots x_{N})=\\frac{1}{L^{N/2}}\n\\]\nThat was easy! The fermion case is harder.\nSince the occupation of each level is at most one, the lowest energy is obtained by filling each level with one particle, starting at the bottom. If we have an odd number of particles, this means filling the levels with \\(n=-(N-1)/2, -(N-3)/2,\\ldots, -1, 0, 1 \\ldots (N-1)/2\\) (for an even number of particles we have to decide whether to put the last particle at \\(n=\\pm N/2\\)). Introducing the complex variables\n\\[\nz_{i}=\\exp(2 \\pi i x_{i}/L),\n\\]\nthe Slater determinant Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n    \\Psi^A_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)=\\begin{vmatrix}\n    z_{1}^{-(N-1)/2} &  z_{2}^{-(N-1)/2} & \\cdots & z_{N}^{-(N-1)/2} \\\\\n    z_{1}^{-(N-3)/2} &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n    \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n    z_{1}^{(N-1)/2} &  \\cdots & \\cdots & z_{N}^{(N-1)/2}\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n\\tag{7}\\]\nLet’s evaluate this complicated looking expression in a simple case. With three particles we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Psi^A_0(x_1,x_2,x_3)&=\\begin{vmatrix}\n        z_{1}^{-1} & z_{2}^{-1} & z_{3}^{-1} \\\\\n        1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n        z_{1} & z_{2} & z_{3}\n    \\end{vmatrix} = \\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}-\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{1}}+\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{1}}-\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{3}}+\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{3}}-\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{2}}\\nonumber\\\\\n    &=\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{1}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{3}}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{1}}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{3}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{2}}}\\right)  \\nonumber\\\\\n    &\\propto \\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{1}-x_{2}]}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{3}-x_{1}]}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{2}-x_{3}]}{L}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nThe vanishing of the wavefunction when \\(x_{i}=x_{j}\\) is consistent with the Pauli principle. You should check that additionally it is periodic and totally antisymmetric.\nEquation 8 generalizes for any (odd) \\(N\\) so that the ground state Slater determinant Equation 7 is proportional to\n\\[\n\\Psi^A_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)\\propto\\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi[x_{i}-x_{j}]}{L}\\right).\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow this using the Vandermonde determinant \\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\\nz_{1} &  z_{2} & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\nz_{1}^{2} & z_{2}^{2} & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\nz_{1}^{N-1} &  z_{2}^{N-1} & \\cdots & z_{N}^{N-1}\n\\end{vmatrix}=\\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N}(z_{j}-z_{i})\n\\] which can be proved in a variety of ways. Proving directly that Equation 9 is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not easy, but can be accomplished using the identity\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{2nd_quant_cotident}\n\\cot(x-y)\\cot(y-z)+\\cot(y-z)\\cot(z-x)+\\cot(z-x)\\cot(x-y)=1. \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nCheck carefully that Equation 9 is periodic and totally antisymmetric.\n\n\nLet’s take the opportunity to introduce some terminology. The wavevector of the last fermion added is called the Fermi wavevector and denoted \\(k_\\text{F}\\). In this case \\(k_\\text{F}=\\frac{(N-1)\\pi}{L}\\). Its energy \\(E_{F}=\\frac{k_\\text{F}^{2}}{2m}\\) is the Fermi energy.\n\n\n2.2 Density; Density Matrix; Pair Distribution\nHaving a many particle wave function is one thing, but what to do with it? Bear in mind that Equation 9 is just about the simplest fermion state you can imagine, but it’s not immediately clear what it is telling us.\n\\(\\vert\\Psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2\\) is the probability distribution of the positions of the particles. If we were able to take a photograph of the positions of the particles at an instant in time, this would correspond to taking a sample from the probability distribution. In terms of the complex variables \\(z_j\\), it would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A sample from the probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi^A_0(z_1,\\ldots,z_N)\\rvert^2\\) for 50 particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Uniformly distributed points on the circle described by \\(\\vert\\Psi^{S}_0(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots x_{N})\\rvert^2\\). The particle positions are uncorrelated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of particle positions for noninteracting fermion and boson ground states.\n\n\n\nSince \\(\\lvert\\Psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2\\) is the probability distribution of the positions of the particles, we can use it to find the marginal probability distributions for any subset of the particles. Of course, since the particles are identical, it doesn’t matter which ones we choose, just the number.\nThe one particle distribution is related to the average density of particles, given by \\[\n\\rho_1(x_1) = N \\int dx_2\\ldots dx_N \\,\\lvert\\Psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2.\n\\tag{10}\\] Note that although I use the symbol \\(\\rho\\), density is always going to be number density (not the mass density).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nCan you explain why this is the density? Think about the simpler case of two particles, with discrete locations. Why is the expected number of particles at position \\(x\\) \\[\nN_x = \\sum_y \\left[P(x,y) + P(y,x)\\right]?\n\\]\nWhat if we have more particles?\n\n\nNormalization of the wavefunction then implies \\[\n\\int dx\\, \\rho_1(x) = N.\n\\] In a translationally invariant system like the fermion gas on a ring we expect the average density to be constant.\nWe can regard Equation 10 as an expectation of a density operator \\[\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_j \\delta(x-x_j),\n\\tag{11}\\] so that \\(\\rho_1(x) = \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\rho(x) \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\\).\nThe single particle density matrix is a generalization of the expectation of the density, and is defined as (we’ll see shortly why this is a useful quantity) \\[\ng(x,y) \\equiv N\\int dx_2\\ldots dx_N \\,\\Psi^{}(x,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\Psi^{*}(y,x_2,\\ldots,x_N).\n\\tag{12}\\] Note that \\(g(x,x) = \\rho_1(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the average number of particles in a single particle state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) is \\[\n\\bar N_\\psi = \\int dx dy\\, \\psi^*(x)g(x,y)\\psi(y).\n\\tag{13}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nStarting from the Slater determinant Equation 7 (i.e. not from the explicit form Equation 9), show that \\(g(x,y)\\) for the ground state of the Fermi gas is \\[\ng(x,y) = \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{|k|&lt;k_\\text{F}} e^{ik(x-y)} = \\int_{k_\\text{F}}^{k_\\text{F}} \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} e^{ik(x-y)} = n \\frac{\\sin \\left[k_\\text{F}(x-y)\\right]}{k_\\text{F}(x-y)}\n\\] where \\(n \\equiv \\frac{k_\\text{F}}{\\pi}\\) is the average density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nFind the average number of particles in a momentum state \\(\\lvert{k}\\rangle\\) using Equation 13 \\[\n\\bar N_k = \\begin{cases}\n1 & |k|\\leq k_\\text{F} \\\\\n0 & |k|&gt;k_\\text{F}\n\\end{cases}.\n\\tag{14}\\] Note that in a translationally invariant system \\(g(x,y)=g(x-y)\\), and is the Fourier transform of \\(\\bar N_k\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo understand the origin of the name single particle density matrix, recall that the density matrix \\(\\varrho\\) describes a mixed state of a quantum system, and is the appropriate description when the quantum state is not known. \\(\\varrho\\) is a positive definite hermitian operator satisfying \\(\\tr \\varrho =1\\). Its spectral resolution \\[\n\\varrho = \\sum_\\alpha p_\\alpha \\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rvert,\n\\] can be thought of as a statistical mixture of different quantum states \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\) with probabilities \\(p_\\alpha\\).\nOne natural way in which density matrices arise from pure states is as follows. The Hilbert space of a composite system consists of a tensor product of two or more components \\(\\mathcal{H}_{AB} = \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B\\). Starting from the density matrix corresponding to a pure state, we can obtain a density matrix for the component \\(A\\) alone by ‘tracing out’ the \\(B\\) subsystem. \\[\n\\varrho_A = \\tr_B \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert,\\quad \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H}_{AB}.\n\\] The probability for system \\(A\\) to be in state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H}_A\\) is \\[\nP_\\psi = \\langle{\\psi}\\rvert\\varrho\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle.\n\\] Thus you can think of the single particle density matrix Equation 12 as arising from tracing out \\(N-1\\) particles from an \\(N\\)-particle system.\nWe can also consider marginal probability distribution of a pair of particles, and define the pair distribution function \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = N(N-1) \\int dx_3\\ldots dx_N \\,\\left|\\Psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\right|^2.\n\\] The prefactor is to account for all pairs of particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nStarting from the Slater determinant Equation 7, show that \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = n^2\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sin\\left[k_\\text{F}(x_1-x_2)\\right]}{k_\\text{F}(x_1-x_2)}\\right)^2\\right].\n\\] This vanishes at \\(x_1=x_2\\), consistent with the Pauli principle.\n\n\nA natural question: \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) \\overset{?}{=} \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x_1)\\rho(x_2)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle.\n\\] Almost. Looking back at Equation 11, we see that the product of two density operators will contain terms involving the same particle, which are absent from \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the correct relationship is \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x_1)\\rho(x_2)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle - \\rho_1(x_1)\\delta(x_1-x_2).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Impenetrable Bose Gas\nThere’s a bit more mileage in the 1D Fermi gas yet. Consider the following Hamiltonian \\[\nH = -\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_j \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_j^2} + \\overbrace{c\\sum_{j&lt;k}\\delta(x_j-x_k)}^{\\equiv H_\\text{int}}.\n\\label{many_LL}\n\\] The second term represents an interaction between pairs of particles. Of course, this model is rather special, as (1) it’s 1D and (2) the interaction potential is a \\(\\delta\\)-function. Nevertheless, it represents a huge step up in difficulty from the noninteracting examples we’ve discussed so far. At least, it does for bosons. For fermions, the wavefunctions vanish at coincident points, and so the interaction has no effect at all!\nFor bosons, it happens that the Hamiltonian can still be solved exactly. For now, however, we’ll concern ourselves only with the limit of infinite interaction: \\(c\\to \\infty\\), sometimes called the impenetrable limit. In this case, the eigenenergies coincide with those of the free fermion problem, and the eigenstates are just the modulus of the corresponding fermion eigenstate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nJust like that, we’ve solved our first interacting many body system (and with infinite coupling, no less)!\nThus the ground state on the ring has the form \\[\n\\Psi_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N) = \\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi[x_{i}-x_{j}]}{L}\\right)\\right|.\n\\]\nIt’s not hard to see why this works. For a state to have a finite energy, the wavefunction must vanish whenever two coordinates coincide. This is because the interation energy has the expectation value \\[\n\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H_\\text{int} \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle=cN(N-1)\\int dx_1\\cdots dx_{N-1}\\left|\n\\Psi(x_1,x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N\\right|^2\n\\] But we already have a complete set of eigenstates that obey this condition, namely the free fermion Slater determinants. It remains to make them symmetric functions by taking the modulus.\nThis mapping is quite powerful, and allows us to calculate any observable of the impenetrable Bose gas in terms of free fermions as long as that observable is insensitive to taking the modulus of the wavefunction. Thus the average density \\(\\rho_1(x)\\) and pair distribution \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\) of the previous section can be found in this way, but the single particle density matrix \\(g(x,y)\\) cannot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow this explicitly.\n\n\nThis means that the momentum distribution is not given by Equation 14. Finding \\(g(x,y)\\) for the impenetrable Bose gas is in fact really hard. We’ll see in a later lecture how to obtain some of its important features.",
