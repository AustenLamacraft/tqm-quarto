The equations of motion are\n\\[\nm \\ddot u_j = k(u_{j-1} + u_{j+1} - 2u_j).\n\\]\nWe look for oscillatory solutions with time dependence \\(u_j(t) = u_j e^{-i\\omega t}\\), arriving at the matrix eigenvalue problem\n\\[\n-\\omega^2 \\begin{pmatrix}\nu_1 \\\\\nu_2 \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\nu_{N-1}\\\\\nu_N\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\frac{k}{m}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\\n1 & -2 & 1 & \\cdots & 0\\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n0 & \\cdot & 1 & -2 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0 & \\cdots & 1 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nu_1 \\\\\nu_2 \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\nu_{N-1}\\\\\nu_N\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nMatrices of this type are called circulant matrices, and arise here because of the translational invariance of the system (including the periodic boundary conditions). Their eigenvectors are given by plane waves \\(u_j = (z_n)^j\\), where \\(z_n\\) is one of the \\(N^\\text{th}\\) roots of unity i.e. \\(z^N = 1\\) or\n\\[\nz_n = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i n}{N}\\right),\\qquad n = 0,\\ldots, N-1.\n\\]\nIn fact, to make things a bit more symmetrical, let’s take \\(N\\) to be odd and index the \\(z_n\\) using both positive and negative values of \\(n\\)\n\\[\nz_n = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i n}{N}\\right),\\qquad n = -(N-1)/2,\\ldots, (N-1)/2.\n\\]\nWe’ll write \\(\\eta_n\\equiv \\frac{2\\pi n}{N}\\), so that the eigenstates have the form \\(u_j=\\exp(i\\eta_n j)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nBy substituting into the equation of motion show that the dispersion relation is \\[\n\\omega(\\eta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}}\\left|\\sin\\eta/2\\right|.\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\nNotice that:\n\nThe frequency vanishes at \\(\\eta\\to 0\\). This mode corresponds to translation of the system, for which there is no restoring force.\nAt small \\(\\eta\\) the dispersion is linear, as we would expect for sound waves.\n\nA general motion of the system can be represented as a superposition of the normal modes \\[\nu_j(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} q_n(t) e^{i\\eta_n j},\n\\label{coll_modes}\n\\] together with the condition \\(q_{-n}=q^*_n\\) on the complex amplitudes to ensure that \\(u_j\\) is real. The amplitudes \\(q_n(t)\\) have time dependence \\[\nq_n(t) = \\alpha_n e^{-i\\omega(\\eta_n) t} + \\beta_n e^{i\\omega(\\eta_n) t}\n\\] for \\(n\\neq 0\\), while for \\(n=0\\) \\[\nq_0(t) = \\sqrt{N}(X+Vt)\n\\] describes the motion of the centre of mass.\n\n\n1.2 Hamiltonian Formulation\nTo make contact with quantum physics, let’s look at this problem from the Hamiltonian perspective. If the \\(q_n\\) are to be our canonical coordinates, then we should likewise write the momenta in terms of Fourier modes \\[\np_j(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\pi_n(t) e^{-i\\eta_n j},\n\\tag{3}\\] If \\(u_j\\), \\(p_j\\) are canonical variables with Poisson Bracket \\(\\{u_j, p_k\\}=\\delta_{jk}\\), then it follows that \\(\\{q_m,\\pi_n\\}=\\delta_{mn}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that in terms of the Fourier modes the Hamiltonian Equation 1 is \\[\nH = \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left[\\frac{1}{2m}\\pi_n \\pi_{-n} + k  (1-\\cos \\eta_n) q_n q_{-n}\\right].\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\nThis almost looks like a system of harmonic oscillators. Bear in mind that the \\(q_n\\) and \\(\\pi_n\\) are complex. One could, for example, split the amplitudes into their real and imaginary parts \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(q_n' + i q_n''\\right),\\quad q_{-n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(q_n' - i q_n''\\right)\\\\\n\\pi_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\pi_n' + i \\pi_n''\\right),\\quad \\pi_{-n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\pi_n' - i \\pi_n''\\right),\\quad n\\geq 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5}\\] The Hamiltonian would then become \\(H=H' + H''\\) with \\[\nH' = \\sum_{0 &lt; n \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left[\\frac{1}{2m}\\pi'_n \\pi'_{n} + k  (1-\\cos \\eta_n) q'_n q'_{n}\\right].\n\\] and similarly for \\(H''\\). By comparing with the standard form \\[\nH_\\text{SHO} = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2,\n\\tag{6}\\] we can read off the dispersion relation Equation 2. The decomposition Equation 5 amounts to working with the real amplitudes of sine and cosine waves. Other options are possible.\n\n\n1.3 Complex Coordinates\nSticking with the classical problem, let’s introduce complex coordinates to describe the two dimensional phase space of a single oscillator \\[\n\\begin{equation}\na = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{2}}\\left(x + \\frac{i}{m\\omega} p \\right).\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{7}\\] \\(a\\) and its conjugate satisfy \\(\\{a^{},a^*\\}=-i\\). This definition is chosen so that the Hamiltonian takes the simple form \\[\nH = \\omega \\left|a\\right|^2.\n\\] Hamilton’s equations of motion are then \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot a &= \\{a, H \\} = -i\\omega a\\\\\n\\dot a^* &= \\{a^*, H \\} = i\\omega a^*.\n\\end{align}\n\\] with solution \\(a(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} a(0)\\) describing circular motion in the complex \\(a\\) plane on a contour of fixed energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nSatisfy yourself — without doing any calculations — that \\(a(t)\\) defined by Equation 7 goes clockwise in the complex plane.\n\n\nIn the same way, we can introduce the coordinates \\[\n\\begin{align}\na_n &= \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}{2}}\\left(q_n + \\frac{i}{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\pi_{-n}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\na^*_n &= \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}{2}}\\left(q_{-n} - \\frac{i}{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\pi_{n}\\right),\\qquad n\\neq 0.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8}\\] Remember that \\(q_n = q_{-n}^*\\) and \\(\\pi_n = \\pi_{-n}^*\\) in order that \\(u_j\\) and \\(p_j\\) are real. Note that \\(n=0\\) is excluded because \\(\\omega(0)=0\\). These coordinates satisfy \\[\n\\{a_m,a^{*}_n\\}=-i\\delta_{mn}.\n\\] Inverting the definition Equation 8 gives \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_n &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2m\\omega(\\eta_n)}}\\left(a_n + a_{-n}^*\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\n\\pi_n &= -i\\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega(\\eta_n)}{2}}\\left(a_{-n} - a_{n}^*\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\] and inserting into the Hamiltonian Equation 4 gives \\[\nH = \\frac{\\pi_0^2}{2m}+\\sum_{\\substack{n\\neq 0 \\\\ |n| \\leq (N-1)/2}} \\omega(\\eta_n) \\left|a_n\\right|^2,\n\\] with the first term accounting for the (free) centre of mass.",

    "text": "2 Quantum Oscillators\nIn the quantum theory, the variables \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\), \\(a^\\dagger\\) satisfy \\([a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}},a^\\dagger]=1\\) and the Hamiltonian Equation 6 takes the form \\[\nH = \\frac{\\omega}{2}\\left(a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}a^\\dagger\\right).\n\\] Let’s remind ourselves how this formalism solves the problem of finding the eigenstates. The key observation is that \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left[a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}, H\\right] &= \\omega a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}},\\\\\n\\left[a^\\dagger, H\\right] &= -\\omega a^\\dagger.\n\\end{align}\n\\] As a result, if \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian \\[\nH \\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle = E \\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle,\n\\] then \\(a^\\dagger\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) is an eigenstate with energy \\(E+\\omega\\) \\[\nH a^\\dagger\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle = a^\\dagger H \\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle + [H, a^\\dagger] \\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle = \\left(E+\\omega\\right)a^\\dagger\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle.\n\\] Similarly \\(a\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) is an eigenstate with energy \\(E-\\omega\\), unless \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle=\\lvert{0}\\rangle\\), the ground state, in which case we must have \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\lvert{0}\\rangle=0\\).\nAs a result, all states can be written as \\[\n\\lvert{n}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\left(a^\\dagger\\right)^n\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\] The factor of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\) normalizes the state. The ground state has energy \\(E_0=\\omega/2\\).\n\n2.1 The Quantum Chain\nThe quantization of the chain is then a piece of cake. We have a system of oscillator variables satisfying \\([a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_m,a^\\dagger_n]=\\delta_{mn}\\), and writing the Hamiltonian Equation 4 in terms of these variables, paying attention to the order, gives \\[\nH = \\frac{\\pi_0^2}{2m}+\\sum_{\\substack{n\\neq 0 \\\\ |n| \\leq (N-1)/2}} \\frac{\\omega(\\eta_n)}{2}\\left(a^\\dagger_na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_n+a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_na^\\dagger_n\\right).\n\\] From now on we will ignore the centre of mass motion. Exactly the same logic as before tells us that a general energy eigenstate may be written \\[\n\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle = \\prod_{\\substack{n\\neq 0 \\\\ |n| \\leq (N-1)/2}} \\frac{\\left(a^\\dagger_n\\right)^{N_n}}{\\sqrt{N_n!}} \\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\] The non-negative integers \\(\\mathbf{N}=\\left(N_{(1-N)/2},\\ldots, N_{-1}, N_{1}, \\ldots N_{(N-1)/2}\\right)\\) describe the occupation numbers of the oscillators. This eigenstate has energy \\[\nE(\\mathbf{N}) = E_0 + \\sum_{\\substack{n\\neq 0 \\\\ |n| \\leq (N-1)/2}} \\omega(\\eta_n) N_n,\n\\] where the ground state energy is \\[\nE_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\omega(\\eta_n).\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\n\n2.2 Oscillator Quanta are Bosons!\nA key moment in the birth of Quantum Field Theory was the realization that oscillator quanta are bosons, meaning that they can be identified with quantum particles having symmetric wavefunctions. We’ll see this in much more detail in later lectures. For the moment, let’s just note that both have a basis of states described in terms of the occupation numbers, which are non-negative integers. In the case of \\(M\\) bosons, those states were written in terms of the single particle wavefunctions \\(\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\) of the bosons as \\[\n\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{M}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_M)=\\sqrt{\\frac{M!}{\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\mathcal{S}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r}_{1})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r}_{2})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{M}}(\\mathbf{r}_{M}),\n\\] where \\(\\mathcal{S}=\\frac{1}{M!}\\sum_{P} P\\) is the operation of symmetrization, and \\(N_\\alpha\\) denotes the number of occurrences of \\(\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\) in the product, so that \\(M=\\sum_\\alpha N_\\alpha\\). It turns out that the Hilbert space spanned by these states is the same as that spanned by the states \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle\\), if the labels \\(\\alpha\\) are identified with the momentum labels \\(n\\).\nIt’s important to note that these bosons are totally distinct from the original particles making up the chain. In fact, or original Hamiltonian Equation 1 doesn’t describe indistinguishable particles as written, as each particle is labelled by its position in the chain, with a particle only interacting with its two neighbours. Since the particles are assumed not to change places, there is no way of assigning statistics to their wavefunction.\n\n\n2.3 Thermodynamic (\\(N\\to \\infty\\)) limit\nIn studying the properties of matter, we are usually interested in taking the limit of an infinite system, otherwise known as the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) or thermodynamic limit. At the very least, we expect the internal energy (as well as other thermodynamic potentials) to be an extensive quantity, meaning that it is proportional to the `size’ of the system, here measured by the number of sites. Thus we expect the limit \\[\ne_0 = \\lim_{N\\to \\infty} \\frac{E_0}{N}\n\\] to exist. The separation of the \\(\\eta_n\\) values is \\(2\\pi/N\\), so as \\(N\\to\\infty\\) the sum in ground state energy Equation 9 can be replaced with an integral according to the rule \\[\n\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left(\\cdots\\right) \\xrightarrow{N\\to\\infty} N \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi}\\left(\\cdots\\right).\n\\] The factor of \\(N\\) tells us that we have an extensive quantity, and \\[\ne_0 = \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\omega(\\eta)}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2m}}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{1-\\cos\n\\eta}=\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}.\n\\] Alternatively, we may treat the \\(N\\to \\infty\\) limit of the chain as a model of an elastic continuum of length \\(L=aN\\). Take \\(m = \\rho a\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the mass per unit length (1D density). The 1D elastic modulus is \\[\n\\kappa \\equiv \\frac{\\text{tension}}{\\text{strain}} = ka\n\\] Then \\(k/m = \\kappa/(\\rho a^2)\\) and \\[\n\\frac{E_0}{L} = \\left(\\frac{N}{L}\\right)^2\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho}}.\n\\] The energy per unit length diverges as \\(N\\to\\infty\\). Thus the ground state energy of a continuous medium is infinite, on account of the infinite number of degrees of freedom it contains. This is only a problem if one insists on such a description: in practice (at least in condensed matter) there is always discreteness on the smallest scales.\nApart from the infinite ground state energy, the continuum limit of our harmonic system is perfectly well defined. Introducing a continuum displacement by \\(u(x=ja)=u_j\\), the potential energy can be written \\[\nV = \\frac{k}{2} \\sum_j^N (u_j-u_{j+1})^2 \\xrightarrow{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^L dx\\, \\left[u'(x)\\right]^2.\n\\] If we define the momentum density at each point by \\(\\pi(x=ja) = p_j N/L\\), then we find the continuum limit of the canonical commutation relations \\[\n\\left[u(x),\\pi(x')\\right]=i\\delta(x-x'),\n\\] together with the kinetic energy \\[\nT = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac{p_j^2}{2m} = \\frac{1}{2\\rho}\\int_0^L dx\\,\\left[\\pi(x)\\right]^2.\n\\] Since we are taking the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit it’s convenient to define the Fourier modes slightly differently \\[\nu(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty u_n e^{ik_n x},\n\\] where \\(k_n =2\\pi n/L\\). Note that \\(k_n x = \\eta_n j\\). We are recycling the notation \\(u_n\\) now that we have taken the limit.\nIf the momentum density \\(\\pi(x)\\) is then written \\[\n\\pi(x) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{p_{j=xN/L}N}{L} =\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\pi_n e^{-2\\pi i nx /L},\n\\] (This differs from Equation 3 by \\(\\pi_n\\to \\pi_n/\\sqrt{N}\\).) we have \\(\\left[u_m,\\pi_n\\right]=\\delta_{mn}\\).\nOur continuum Hamiltonian \\(H= T+V\\) is then written in Fourier components as \\[\nH = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\left[\\frac{1}{2\\rho L} \\pi_n\\pi_{-n} + \\frac{\\kappa L k_n^2}{2}  u_nu_{-n} \\right].\n\\] We can now read off the dispersion relation \\[\n\\omega(k) = c|k|,\n\\] where \\(c=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho}}\\) is the speed of sound. Note that the continuum limit has lead to a linear dispersion relation. This is reasonable: the lattice was the origin of the periodic dispersion relation Equation 2, and it has now disappeared.\nTranscribing the definition of the oscillator variables Equation 8 gives \\[\n\\begin{align}\na_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\sqrt{ZkL} u_n + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{ZkL}}\\pi_{-n}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\na^*_n &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\sqrt{ZkL} u_{-n} - \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{ZkL}}\\pi_{n}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(Z\\equiv\\sqrt{\\kappa\\rho}\\) is the impedance. After quantization, the Hamiltonian takes the form \\[\nH - E_0 = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty c\\left|k_n\\right|a^\\dagger_na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_n.\n\\label{coll_excess}\n\\] This expresses the energy above the ground state in terms of the occupancy of the oscillator modes.\n\n\n2.4 Finite Temperature\nAt finite temperature \\(T\\) the occupancies of the modes have thermal averages given by the Bose occupation function \\[\n\\langle N_n \\rangle = n_\\text{B}(\\omega(\\eta_n))\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\beta\\omega(\\eta_n)\\right)-1},\n\\tag{10}\\] where \\(\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_\\text{B}T}\\). The thermal average of the energy of excited states is then \\[\n\\langle H - E_0 \\rangle =\\sum_{|n|\\leq (N-1)/2} \\omega(\\eta_n)n_\\text{B}(\\omega(\\eta_n)).\n\\] This is finite, even in the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit, on account of the exponential tail of Equation 10. Remember that this was the problem that the quantum theory was introduced to solve. At low energies \\(n_{\\text{B}}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\beta\\omega}\\) and the contribution of each mode is \\[\n\\omega n_\\text{B}(\\omega) \\xrightarrow{\\omega\\to 0}  k_\\text{B}T,\n\\] in agreement with the classical equipartition theorem. Were this result to apply at all energies the thermal energy density of a continuum at finite temperature would be infinite (the Ultraviolet Catastrophe). It is the existence of Planck’s constant, which appears in the dimensionless combination \\(\\hbar\\beta\\omega\\) in the Bose occupation function, that allows this conclusion to be avoided.\n\n\n2.5 Position Fluctuations\nClassically, the ground state configuration of our elastic chain corresponds to a regular ‘crystalline’ arrangement of masses at separation \\(a\\), with all \\(u_j=0\\). Mass \\(j\\) and mass \\(k\\) are then separated by \\((j-k)a + u_j-u_k = (j-k)a\\). Quantum mechanically, \\(u_j-u_k\\) fluctuates, even in the ground state. For the notion of a crystal to make sense, these fluctuations should not be too large. Let’s evaluate them for the elastic chain.\nWe want to evaluate \\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_j-u_k\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\label{coll_gsfluct}\n\\] To do this, we write the displacements in terms of the oscillator variables, and then evaluate the expectation values in the ground state using the oscillator algebra. Recall that \\[\nu_j = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} q_n e^{i\\eta_n j},\n\\tag{11}\\] and \\[\nq_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2m\\omega(\\eta_n)}}\\left(a_n + a_{-n}^\\dagger\\right).\n\\] To evaluate \\(\\eqref{coll_gsfluct}\\), we write the two factors \\((u_j-u_k)(u_j-u_k)\\) in terms of the \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_n\\) and \\(a^\\dagger_n\\). Contributions to the ground state expectation value arise from terms with \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_n\\) in the left factor and \\(a^\\dagger_n\\) in the right for some \\(n\\). All other terms vanish. This gives \\[\n\\begin{multline}\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_j-u_k\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle \\\\ = \\frac{1}{2mN} \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\frac{1}{\\omega(\\eta_n)} \\left[e^{i\\eta_n j}- e^{i\\eta_n k}\\right]\\left[e^{-i\\eta_n j}- e^{-i\\eta_n k}\\right].\n\\end{multline}\n\\] Taking the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit in the sum gives \\[\n\\begin{multline}\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_j-u_k\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{mN}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta_n[j-k]\\right)}{\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\\\ = \\frac{1}{m}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta[j-k]\\right)}{\\omega(\\eta)}.\n\\end{multline}\n\\tag{12}\\] The dispersion relation Equation 2 makes this integral a little difficult.\n\n\n\nThe integrand in Equation 12 for \\(j-k=20\\). What form does it take for \\(\\left|j-k\\right|^{-1}\\lesssim\\eta\\lesssim \\pi\\)?.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhen \\(\\left|j-k\\right|\\gg 1\\), the integral is dominated by values of \\(\\left|j-k\\right|^{-1}\\lesssim\\eta\\lesssim \\pi\\). In this limit the dispersion can be linearized\n\\[\n\\omega(\\eta) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}|\\eta|.\n\\] Show that we then have\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left(u_i-u_j\\right)^2\\lvert{0}\\rangle \\sim  \\frac{\\ell_\\text{osc}^2}{\\pi} \\log \\left|i-j\\right|,\\qquad \\text{ as } \\left|i-j\\right|\\to\\infty\n\\tag{13}\\]\nwhere we have introduced \\(\\ell_\\text{osc}=\\left(km\\right)^{-1/4}\\), the natural length scale of an oscillator. If you find this derivation a bit vague, an evaluation of the integral Equation 12 is given in the Section 3.2.\n\n\nThe result Equation 13 shows that the uncertainty in the separation of two masses in the chain increases with their separation. This implies that the ground state of the chain is not a crystal, but more closely resembles a fluid. It turns out that this conclusion depends strongly on the dimensionality of the system. In higher dimensions, crystalline ground states do exist (thankfully).\n\n\n2.6 Density Fluctuations\nAn alternative way of quantifying crystalline order is to consider the fluctuations of the density of particles, defined by \\[\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\delta_L(x-x_j),\n\\] where \\(x_j = ja + u_j\\), and \\(\\delta_L(x)\\) is an \\(L\\)-periodic version of the \\(\\delta\\)-function, if we want to stick with a finite size system. Alternatively, we may consider the Fourier components \\[\n\\rho_k = \\sum_{j=1}^N\\exp(-i k x_j).\n\\] Rather than introducing separate notation for the Fourier components of \\(f(x)\\), it’s convenient to denote them by \\(f_q\\), so that \\[\nf(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty f_{k_n} \\exp(ik_n x), \\qquad k_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\n\\] In an ordered configuration \\(x_j = ja\\), we would have \\[\n\\rho_{k_n} = \\begin{cases}\nN & n = 0 \\mod N \\\\\n0 & \\text{ otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] These peaks at values of \\(k\\) corresponding to multiples of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\) are nothing but the Bragg peaks observed in a diffraction experiment, which translates the real space crystal arrangement into Fourier space. Note that an overall translation of lattice will just change the phase of the $ _k$, leaving \\(\\left|\\rho_k\\right|^2\\) (proportional to the intensity measured in a diffraction experiment) unchanged.\nHow is this picture altered in the quantum mechanical ground state? Given the above comment, we should evaluate \\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\sum_{j,k=1}^N \\langle{0}\\rvert \\exp(iq[x_j-x_k])\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\tag{14}\\] Upon substituting the mode expansion Equation 11 for the displacements, we are left to evaluate expressions of the form \\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ \\mu a^\\dagger)\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nProve the Hadamard Lemma\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ne^{A}B e^{-A} &= B + \\left[A,B\\right] + \\frac{1}{2!}\\left[A,\\left[A,B\\right]\\right]+\\frac{1}{3!}\\left[A,\\left[A,\\left[A,B\\right]\\right]\\right]+\\ldots \\\\\n&\\equiv e^{\\left[A,\\cdot\\right]}B,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n[Hint: Consider the differential equation in \\(x\\) obeyed by \\(e^{xA}B e^{-xA}\\)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the exponent can be written in a form with all occurrences of \\(a^\\dagger\\) to the left of all \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\) (this operation is called normal ordering; we will meet it again).\n\\[\n\\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ \\mu a^\\dagger) = \\exp(\\lambda \\mu /2) \\exp(\\mu a^\\dagger)\\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}).\n\\] [Hint: Consider the differential equations obeyed by \\(F_1(s)=e^{s(A+B)}\\) and \\(F_2(s)=e^{sA}e^{sB}\\)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nUse this result to show that\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\exp(\\lambda a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ \\mu a^\\dagger)\\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\exp(\\lambda \\mu /2).\n\\]\n\n\nDeploying this strategy for Equation 14 gives \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\sum_{j,k=1}^N &\\exp(iqa[j-k])\\\\\n&\\times\\exp\\left(-\\frac{q^2}{2mN}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta_n[j-k]\\right)}{\\omega(\\eta_n)}\\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\n\nNumerical evaluation of \\(\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{0}\\rangle\\) for \\(\\ell_\\text{osc}/a=0.2\\), \\(N=51\\).

These remnants of order diminish as \\(\\ell_\\text{osc}/a\\) increases, indicating larger quantum fluctuations. Again, things are different in higher dimensions: the Bragg peaks survive, albeit reduced in strength, at least for small fluctuations. It is possible, however, for quantum fluctuations to prevent crystallization in the ground state (i.e. at zero temperature). Such systems are called quantum liquids. Helium is the prototypical example: the low atomic mass and relatively weak interactions between atoms mean that quantum fluctuations are large.",

    "section": "3 Appendix",
    "text": "3 Appendix\n\n3.1 Fourier review\nThis is a good place to collect some facts about Fourier transforms. We start from the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which is a change of basis in a finite dimensional space. This is what we used in discussing the chain. There are then two ways to pass to the infinite continuous case described by the Fourier transform.\n\n3.1.1 Discrete Fourier Transform\nFor a vector \\(x_j = 1,\\ldots N\\) (\\(N\\) taken to be odd), we define the DFT by \\[\nF_n = \\sum_{j=1}^N f_j e^{-i\\eta_n j},\n\\tag{15}\\] where \\(\\eta_n\\equiv \\frac{2\\pi n}{N}\\), and \\(n = -(N-1)/2,\\ldots, (N-1)/2\\). The key to inverting Equation 15 is the observation \\[\n\\sum_{n=-(N-1)/2}^{(N-1)/2} e^{i\\eta_n j} = \\begin{cases}\n0 & j\\neq 0 \\mod N\\\\\nN & j = 0 \\mod N.\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{16}\\]\n\nPerhaps the slickest way to to see this is to observe that \\[\nz^N-1 = (z-1)(1 + z + z^2 +\\cdots z^{N-1})\n\\] Can you fill in the rest of the argument?\n\nThis gives \\[\nf_j = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=-(N-1)/2}^{(N-1)/2}  F_n e^{i\\eta_n j}.\n\\tag{17}\\] A more democratic definition would have \\(1/\\sqrt{N}\\) in both definitions Equation 15 and Equation 17. This would allow us to regard the DFT as a basis change to an orthonormal basis of vectors \\(e^{(n)}_j = \\frac{e^{i\\eta_n j}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\), and both the DFT and its inverse would be unitary transformations.\n\n\n3.1.2 \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit\nIn this limit the \\(\\eta_n\\) values become dense in the range \\((-\\pi,\\pi]\\), with separation \\(\\Delta \\eta = 2\\pi/N\\), and we replace the sum in the inverse DFT Equation 17 by an integral according to the prescription \\[\n\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left(\\cdots\\right) \\xrightarrow{N\\to\\infty} N \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi}\\left(\\cdots\\right),\n\\] giving \\[\nf_j = \\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi}\\,F(\\eta) e^{i\\eta j}.\n\\]\n\n\n3.1.3 \\(N\\to\\infty\\), with \\(f_j = f(jL/N)\\),\nAlternatively, regard the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit as sampling a function \\(f(x)\\) ever more finely in the range (0,L]. Now it’s the DFT, rather than the inverse, that becomes an integral \\[\n\\hat f(k) \\equiv \\int_0^L f(x) e^{-ik_n x}\\,dx,\n\\] where \\(k_n =2\\pi n/L\\). Note that \\(k_n x = \\eta_n j\\). The pair of transformations is now \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat f_k &= \\int_0^L f(x) e^{-ik_n x}\\,dx\\nonumber\\\\\nf(x) &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k \\hat f_k e^{ik_n x}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{18}\\] This is the conventional form of the Fourier series for a function with period \\(L\\).\nWith this definition \\(\\hat f_k\\) has an extra dimension of distance (on account of the integral), which gets removed by the \\(1/L\\) in the inverse transform.\nThe analog of the identity Equation 16 is \\[\n\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k e^{ik x} = \\delta_L(x),\n\\] where \\(\\delta_L(x)\\) is an \\(L\\)-periodic version of the \\(\\delta\\)-function.\n\n\n3.1.4 \\(L\\to\\infty\\)\nFinally we arrive at the Fourier transform, where we take \\(L\\to\\infty\\), so that the inverse transform in Equation 18 becomes an integral too \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{f}(k) & = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) e^{-ik_n x}\\,dx\\nonumber\\\\\nf(x) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat f(k) e^{ik_n x}\\,\\frac{dk}{2\\pi}.\n\\label{coll_FTTrans}\n\\end{align}\n\\] My preference is for taking this limit at the last possible moment, that is, sticking with discrete Fourier sums for as long as possible. There are some good(ish) reasons for this\n\nWriting \\(\\sum_k\\) is easier than \\(L\\int \\frac{dk}{2\\pi}\\), because the \\(k_n = 2\\pi n/L\\) can be left implicit.\nLeaving \\(k\\) as a subscript means we don’t need the tilde to distinguish \\(f(x)\\) and \\(f_k\\).\nThere are times where taking the limit leads to a divergent integral, while the sums remain finite. This almost always tells us that there is something interesting going on when we are trying to pass to an infinite system.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Properties of the Fourier Transform\nHere are some properties that hold for all of the above.\n\nIf \\(f(x)\\) is real \\(f_k = \\left[f_{-k}\\right]^*\\).\nIf \\(f(x)\\) is even, \\(f_k\\) is even.\n(Ergo) if \\(f(x)\\) is real and even, so is \\(f_k\\).\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Fourier Transforms of Products\nFrequently we have to transform products, so we use the convolution theorem \\[\nf(x)g(x) = \\frac{1}{L^2}\\sum_{k,k'}  f_k  g_k = \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_q \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k  f_k  g_{q-k} \\right)e^{iqx},\n\\] which shows us that \\[\nf(x)g(x) \\stackrel{\\text{FT}}{\\longleftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k  f_k  g_{q-k},\n\\] the latter being a discrete convolution.\nFrequently we’ll have to calculate integrals of such products. I record some examples to give you the general idea \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^L f(x)g(x)\\,dx &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k  f_k  g_{-k}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\int_{0}^L f'(x)g'(x)\\,dx &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k k^2 f_k  g_{-k}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\int_{0}^L f(x)g(x)h(x)\\,dx &=  \\frac{1}{L^2}\\sum_{\\substack{k_1,k_2,k_3 \\\\ k_1+k_2+k_3=0}}  f_{k_1} g_{k_2} h_{k_3}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\int_0^\\infty  \\phi(x)V(x-y)\\phi(y)\\,dx \\,dy &= \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{q}  \\phi_{-q} V_q \\phi_q\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{19}\\] Note that you can be guided to the right number of factors of \\(1/L\\) by dimensional considerations, or from the number of ‘free’ sums over wavevectors.\nFinally, we often encounter the situation where we have two (or more) arguments, but there is only dependence on the difference, for example \\[\nF(x,x') = f(x-x').\n\\] In this case \\[\nF_{k,k'} = f_k\\delta_{k,-k'}.\n\\] In the \\(L\\to\\infty\\) limit this is \\[\n\\hat F(k,k') = \\hat f(k) (2\\pi)\\delta(k+k').\n\\] \\((2\\pi)\\delta(k+k')\\) is the \\(L\\to\\infty\\) limit of \\(L\\delta_{k,-k'}\\) as \\[\n\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_k L\\delta_k \\xrightarrow{L\\to\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} 2\\pi \\delta(k)\n\\] With practice, you will find you are able to write down the right hand sides of expressions like Equation 19 without too much difficulty.\n\n\n3.1.7 Higher dimensions\nThis all generalizes to higher dimensions straightforwardly. For example \\[\n\\frac{1}{L^d}\\sum_\\mathbf{k}(\\cdots) \\xrightarrow{L\\to\\infty} \\int (\\cdots) \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^d}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nPractice writing out Equation 19 in \\(d\\) dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Evaluating Equation 12\nWe want to evaluate \\[\nI(j)\\equiv\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(\\eta j\\right)}{\\sin(\\eta/2)}d\\eta\n\\] for integer \\(j\\). We can write this as \\[\nI(j)=\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1-e^{i\\eta j}}{\\sin(\\eta/2)}d\\eta= -2i\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} e^{i\\eta/2}\\frac{1-e^{i\\eta j}}{1-e^{i\\eta}}d\\eta\n\\] because the imaginary part of the integrand vanishes on integration. Now notice that the integrand involves the geometric series \\[\n\\frac{1-e^{i\\eta j}}{1-e^{i\\eta}} = 1 + e^{i\\eta} + \\cdots e^{i\\eta(j-1)},\n\\] so we can do the integrals term by term to give \\[\nI(j) = 4\\sum_{n=1}^j \\frac{1}{n+1/2}\\sim 4\\log j.\n\\] When all factors are replaced, this yields Equation 13.",

    "text": "2 The Heisenberg Ferromagnetic Chain\n\n2.1 States and operators\nOne spin-1/2 is described by a state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. It’s common to choose as a basis the eigenstates of \\(s^z\\). If we denote these as \\(\\lvert{\\pm}\\rangle\\) with \\(s^z\\lvert{\\pm}\\rangle = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\lvert{\\pm}\\rangle\\), we write \\[\n\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle = \\psi_+\\lvert{+}\\rangle + \\psi_-\\lvert{-}\\rangle=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\psi_+ \\\\\n\\psi_-\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nFor \\(N\\) spins we take basis of product states\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\cdots \\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle, \\qquad \\text{where } \\sigma_j=\\pm.\n\\]\nWe met product states as explicit wavefunctions in Lecture 1. The abstract structure is called a tensor product, normally denoted\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\otimes\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle\n\\]\nWe normally drop the \\(\\otimes\\) for brevity.

The spin operators obey the usual commutation relations\n\\[\n[s^a,s^b]=i\\epsilon_{abc}s^c\n\\]\nFor \\(N\\) spins we write \\(s^a_j\\) for a spin operator acting on \\(j^\\text{th}\\) spin\n\\[\ns^a_j\\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\cdots \\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle = \\lvert{\\sigma_1}\\rangle\\lvert{\\sigma_2}\\rangle\\cdots \\lvert{\\sigma_{j-1}}\\rangle (s^a \\lvert{\\sigma_j}\\rangle) \\lvert{\\sigma_{j+1}}\\rangle\\cdots\\lvert{\\sigma_N}\\rangle,\n\\]\nAlternatively, we may express this as\n\\[\ns^a_j = \\overbrace{\\mathbb{1}\\otimes \\cdots \\mathbb{1}}^{j-1}\\otimes s^a \\otimes \\overbrace{\\mathbb{1} \\otimes\\cdots \\mathbb{1}}^{N-j}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhat is \\([s^a_j,s^b_k]\\) for \\(j\\neq k\\)?\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Ground State\nLet’s try and guess some eigenstates. For simplicity we’ll begin with the 1D case, where the spins are arranged in a chain\n\\[\nH = J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathbf{s}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{j+1},\n\\]\nand as usual we take \\(\\mathbf{s}_j=\\mathbf{s}_{j+N}\\) (periodic boundary conditions). Such a system is called a spin chain. Surprisingly enough, crystals do exist in which magnetic atoms are arranged in this way, with only weak coupling between neighbouring chains. So models of this type are a useful description, at least in some energy window, of real materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhat is the dimension of the Hilbert in which the Hamiltonian acts?\n\n\nSince Equation 1 is supposed to be a model for a magnet, we might try the state with all spins aligned\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle \\equiv \\prod_{j=1}^N \\lvert{+}\\rangle_j,\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere for brevity we write \\(\\lvert{+}\\rangle_j = \\lvert{s^z=+1/2}\\rangle_j\\). It’s not hard to check that this is an eigenstate with energy \\(E_0\\equiv JN/4\\). Furthermore it’s an eigenstate of \\(S^z\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}^2\\), where \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is the total spin\n\\[\n\\mathbf{S} = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathbf{s}_j.\n\\]\nThe eigenvalues are \\(S^z = N/2\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}^2 = \\frac{N}{2}\\left(\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right)\\). The rotational invariance of the Hamiltonian implies that the state \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\) should be a member of a multiplet of \\(N+1\\) degenerate eigenstates related by rotations. These states can be generated by acting on \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\) with \\(S^-=S^x-iS^y\\). The first is\n\\[\nS^-\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^N s^-_j\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\lvert{+}\\rangle_1\\lvert{+}\\rangle_2\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j-1} \\lvert{-}\\rangle_j\\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j+1}\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_N.\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nVerify that \\(S^z = N/2-1\\), but that \\(\\mathbf{S}^2\\) and \\(H\\) are unchanged.\n\n\nEquation 2 is a superposition of terms with one spin flipped. If we continue the process to explore the whole multiplet, we will at each state end up with a constant amplitude superposition of all states with two spins flipped (for \\(S^z=N/2-2\\)), three flipped (for \\(S^z=N/2-3\\)) and so on.\nAre these the ground states for \\(J&lt;0\\)? One way to convince ourselves is to write the Hamiltonian as\n\\[\nH = J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathbf{s}_j \\cdot\\mathbf{s}_{j+1} = J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[(\\mathbf{s}_j+\\mathbf{s}_{j+1})^2-\\mathbf{s}_j^2 - \\mathbf{s}_{j+1}^2\\right]\n= -\\frac{3JN}{2} + J \\sum_{j=1}^N (\\mathbf{s}_j+\\mathbf{s}_{j+1})^2.\n\\]\nIt’s then clear that the last term is minimized if every neighbouring pair of spins has total spin \\(1\\), as they do for \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\). Are there other states that satisfy this condition?\n\n\n2.3 First Excited States\nWhat about just one of the states in the superposition Equation 2?\n\\[\n\\lvert{j}\\rangle = \\lvert{+}\\rangle_1\\lvert{+}\\rangle_2\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j-1} \\lvert{-}\\rangle_j\\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j+1}\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_N.\n\\]\nIs this an eigenstate? Let’s try acting on this state with the Hamiltonian. It’s convenient to write the terms in the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in terms of raising and lowering operators\n\\[\n\\mathbf{s}_j \\cdot \\mathbf{s}_{j+1} = s^z_js^z_{j+1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(s^+_js^-_{j+1} +s^-_js^+_{j+1}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\ns^+ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix},\\qquad s^- = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nNow note that\n\\[\n\\left(s^+_j s^-_{j+1} +s^-_js^+_{j+1}\\right)\\lvert{+}\\rangle_j\\lvert{-}\\rangle_{j+1} = \\lvert{-}\\rangle_j\\lvert{+}\\rangle_{j+1}.\n\\]\nIt then follows that the action of \\(H\\) on the state \\(\\lvert{j}\\rangle\\) is\n\\[\nH\\lvert{j}\\rangle = (1-N/4) \\lvert{j}\\rangle - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lvert{j-1}\\rangle+\\lvert{j+1}\\rangle\\right).\n\\]\n(I’ve set \\(J=-1\\) as it’s the only scale in the problem, so no harm done.) Acting with \\(H\\) therefore leaves us within the subspace spanned by the states \\(\\lvert{j}\\rangle\\). It had to, of course: this is the subspace with \\(S_z=N/2-1\\). We can think of down spins as being like particles, with the Hamiltonian conserving their number.\nWe can easily diagonalize \\(H\\) in this space by noting that it corresponds to a circulant matrix. As we saw in Lecture 3, the eigenstates are plane waves\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\eta}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\\eta j}\\lvert{j}\\rangle,\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwith \\(\\eta = \\frac{2\\pi n}{N}\\), \\(n = -(N-1)/2,\\ldots, (N-1)/2\\). The eigenvalues are \\(E = E_0 + \\omega(\\eta)\\), with\n\\[\n\\omega(\\eta) = 2\\sin^2\\eta/2.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNote that the dispersion relation is periodic, as in the case of the elastic chain, but is now quadratic, rather than linear, at small \\(\\eta\\). \\(\\eta=0\\) corresponds to the state Equation 2, and indeed the energy \\(\\omega(0)=0\\) in that case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a general principle at work here: excitations that correspond at long wavelengths to symmetry operations have to have gapless dispersion relations. In field theory this follows from a general result called Goldstone’s theorem.\n\n\n\nIf we are thinking of the down spin as a particle, then the eigenstates Equation 3 are like plane wave states. These excitations are known as magnons.\n\n\n2.4 \\(N\\)-Magnon States\nAny system at finite temperature has a finite energy density, or a total energy proportional to the system size. Since a magnon has a microscopic energy set by \\(J\\), such a system will presumably have many magnons (many flipped spins). As we increase the number of flipped spins, we increase the size of the subspace in which \\(H\\) acts – it has dimension \\(\\binom{N}{n}\\) for \\(n\\) flipped spins i.e. \\(S^z = N/2-n\\). Things are obviously going to get difficult quickly! The case of two magnons is discussed in the Appendix. It turns out that for the Heisenberg model we are lucky, and we even know the form of a general energy eigenstate with \\(n\\) flipped spin. It’s called Bethe’s ansatz and we’ll meet it in Lecture 15.\nWe started our discussion with the ground state of the ferromagnetic \\(J&lt;0\\) Heisenberg model. What about \\(J&gt;0\\)? Can we guess the ground state in this case (of course, that’s equivalent to finding the highest excited state of the ferromagnet). Bethe’s ansatz tells us that it must be some complicated gas of magnons, all scattering off each other. Why are things so complicated?\n\n\n2.5 Antiferromagnets Are Different!\nLet’s try and guess the ground state of the antiferromagnet. Since anti-aligning spins should be favoured, we might try\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle  \\equiv \\lvert{+}\\rangle_1\\lvert{-}\\rangle_{2}\\cdots \\lvert{+}\\rangle_{N-1}\\lvert{-}\\rangle_{N},\n\\tag{5}\\]\nassuming \\(N\\) is even. Acting with the \\(H\\) reveals that we are out of luck, however. The reason is simple: regarding the down spins as particles arranged on every other site, the spin flip terms of the Hamiltonian cause them to move about. This is Bethe’s dense gas of interacting magnons.\nBut antiferromagnets, with the kind of alternating order described by Equation 5 do exist! In fact, their existence was predicted by Louis Néel in 1936 before their experimental discovery. Equation 5 is sometimes called a Néel state for this reason. In Section 5.2 you’ll find a discussion of what we mean when say that a system has an antiferromagnetic ground state, using a simple model.\nThe Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chain does not have an antiferromagnetic ground state. The reason, as we’ll see, is similar to that behind the absence of Bragg peaks in the elastic chain: quantum fluctuations are too strong. On the square and cubic lattices, the Heisenberg model does display antiferromagnetism in the ground state. The above considerations show us, however, that these states are a bit more complicated than Equation 5.",

    "text": "3 Large \\(s\\) Expansion\nA common strategy when faced with an intractable model is to generalize it to a family of models indexed by a parameter that may be used as an expansion parameter in some approximation scheme. In this section we’ll see an example of this approach by generalizing the Heisenberg model to arbitrary spin.\n\n3.1 Holstein–Primakoff Representation of Spin\nThis is a way of representing spins in terms of oscillator variables so that a problem of coupled spins becomes a problem of coupled oscillators, of the kind we studied in Lecture 3. Since the map is nonlinear, the problem is not harmonic, although a harmonic approximation is a useful first step that turns out to be justified when the spins are large.\nThe representation is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ns^+ &=\\sqrt{2s}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}}{2s}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\\\\ns^- &= \\sqrt{2s}a^\\dagger\\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}}{2s}} \\\\\ns^z &= \\left(s - a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nI’m going to leave it up to you to confirm that \\([a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}},a^\\dagger]=1\\) reproduces the spin commutation relations, and this problem from Problem Set 1 should demystify why this works to some extent. A rough understanding is as follows. \\(s^{\\pm}\\) and \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\), \\(a^\\dagger\\) evidently have something in common in that they shift us up and down a ladder of states. That’s why the relation between \\(s^z\\) and the number of quanta in the oscillator is so simple. The oscillator ground state corresponds to \\(\\lvert{s,s}\\rangle\\).\nThe difference is that in the spin case the ladder is finite, while in the oscillator it is (semi-)infinite. Thus we can’t just have \\(s^+\\propto a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\). We must have something that stops us lowering beyond \\(s^z=-s\\), corresponding to \\(2s\\) oscillator quanta. That’s the function of the factor in the square root in \\(s^-\\).\n\n\n3.2 Harmonic Spin Waves\nA large \\(s\\) approximation already presents itself\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ns^+ &\\sim \\sqrt{2s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\nonumber\\\\\ns^- &\\sim  \\sqrt{2s}a^\\dagger\\nonumber\\\\\ns_z &= \\left(s - a^\\dagger a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe are neglecting terms of order \\(s^{-1/2}\\). The point about this approximation is that it is just what is needed to turn our Heisenberg Hamiltonian into a quadratic oscillator Hamiltonian. We get \\[\nH = J\\sum_j \\left[(s-a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j)(s-a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j) + sa^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1}+s a^\\dagger_{j+1}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\right].\n\\] This isn’t quadratic, but note that the quartic terms have a lower power of \\(s\\), so in the same approximation we should drop them to give \\[\n\\begin{equation}\nH \\sim NJs^2 + sJ\\sum_j \\left[a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1}+a^\\dagger_{j+1}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j - 2a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\right].\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{7}\\] We can already see that the state with no quanta (\\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle=0\\)) is an eigenstate. In fact this is just the spin-\\(s\\) generalization of the state \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle\\) \\[\n\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle_s \\equiv \\prod_{j=1}^N \\lvert{s,s}\\rangle_j,\n\\] and is the ground state for \\(J&lt;0\\). We could continue to analyze Equation 7 in terms of the operators \\(a^\\dagger_j\\) and \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\) see this problem from Problem Sheet 1, but instead we’re going to write Equation 6 as\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ns^x &\\sim \\sqrt{s}x \\nonumber\\\\\ns^y &\\sim  \\sqrt{s}p\\nonumber\\\\\ns_z &= \\left(s - \\frac{1}{2}[x^2 + p^2 - 1] \\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+a^\\dagger)\\) and \\(p = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(a^\\dagger-a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}})\\) are canonical position and momentum coordinates.\nDoing this for each spin in our chain gives the Hamiltonian\n\\[\nH\\sim NJ s^2 + sNJ+ \\overbrace{sJ \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[x_j x_{j+1} + p_j p_{j+1}-x_j^2 - p_j^2\\right]}^{\\equiv H^{(2)}} + \\ldots,\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere we are dropping terms that are lower order in \\(s\\). Equation 8 has the form of an harmonic chain, albeit one with a rather strange looking mass term. We can diagonalize it by using the Fourier expansion of the position and momentum as before\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_j(t) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} q_n(t) e^{i\\eta_n j},\\nonumber\\\\\np_j(t) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\pi_n(t) e^{-i\\eta_n j}.\n\\label{spin_Fourier}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn terms of these modes \\(H^{(2)}\\) takes the form\n\\[\nH^{(2)} = -2sJ \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\sin^2(\\eta_n/2)\\left[q_n q_{-n} + \\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right].\n\\tag{9}\\]\nComparing with our treatment of the elastic chain, we can read of the dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{FM}}(\\eta) = 4s\\left|J\\right|\\sin^2(\\eta/2)\n\\]\nin agreement with Equation 4 for \\(s=1/2\\). Incidentally, in order that the ground state energy is \\(NJ s^2\\) with no correction at order \\(s\\), the ground state energy of the oscillators must cancel the second term of Equation 8. In other words, \\[\n\\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\sin^2(\\eta_n/2)\\langle{0}\\rvert\\left[q_n q_{-n} + \\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right]\\lvert{0}\\rangle=\\frac{N}{2}.\n\\tag{10}\\]\nThe harmonic approximation applies close to the ferromagnetic state, where there are few oscillator quanta. If the typical values of \\(a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\) are small — we’ve seen \\(a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j=0\\) in the ground state — the approximation \\(\\sqrt{1-\\frac{a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j}{2s}}\\sim 1\\) that gave rise to Equation 6 is justified, and neglecting anharmonic terms is reasonable.\nWhat about the case of antiferromagnetic coupling (\\(J&gt;0\\))? Even though the generalization of Equation 5\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle_s \\equiv \\lvert{s,s}\\rangle_1\\lvert{s,-s}\\rangle_{2}\\cdots \\lvert{s,s}\\rangle_{N-1}\\lvert{s,-s}\\rangle_{N},\n\\]\nis not a ground state, it might be close. We can’t apply the approximation Equation 6 directly, however, because this state has zero quanta on the odd sites, but \\(2s\\) quanta on the odd sites. To apply our approximation to states close to \\(\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle_s\\) we rotate every other spin through \\(\\pi\\) about the \\(y\\) axis, so that\n\\[\n(s^x_j,s^y_j,s^z_j)\\longrightarrow (-s^x_j,s^y_j,-s^z_j),\\quad j\\text{ odd}.\n\\]\nThe Heisenberg chain Hamiltonian then becomes\n\\[\nH = -J \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[s^x_j s^x_{j+1} - s^y_j s^y_{j+1} + s^z_j s^z_{j+1}\\right].\n\\]\nNow we proceed exactly as before. In approximating this Hamiltonian by a harmonic description close to the ferromagnetic state \\(\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle_s\\), we are in fact working close to the antiferromagnetic state \\(\\lvert{\\text{AFM}}\\rangle_s\\) in the original variables. The oscillator Hamiltonian is now\n\\[\nH^{(2)} = 2sJ \\sum_{|n| \\leq (N-1)/2} \\left[\\sin^2(\\eta/2)q_n q_{-n} + \\cos^2(\\eta/2)\\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right],\n\\tag{11}\\]\ncorresponding to a dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{AFM}}(\\eta) = 2sJ\\left|\\sin(\\eta)\\right|.\n\\tag{12}\\]\nThis is rather different to the ferromagnetic case. Note that it vanishes both \\(\\eta=0\\) and at the Brillouin zone boundary \\(\\eta=\\pi\\), and is linear in the vicinity of both points, compared with the quadratic behaviour of the ferromagnet. The reason for the difference is clear on comparing Equation 9 and Equation 11. In the first case both the position and momentum terms vanish at \\(\\eta=0\\), while in the second only the position term vanishes here, with the momentum term vanishing at \\(\\eta=\\pi\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nCan you figure out why?\n\n\nIncidentally, the Bethe ansatz solution of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain yields dispersion relation for the lowest excited state of momentum \\(\\eta\\) (des Cloiseaux–Pearson dispersion)\n\\[\n\\omega_{\\text{dCP}}(\\eta) = \\frac{\\pi J}{2}\\left|\\sin(\\eta)\\right|,\n\\tag{13}\\]\nwhich has the same functional form, but with a different overall scale. You shouldn’t read too much into this, as our calculation is valid at large \\(s\\).\nThe halving of the period of the dispersion Equation 12 is due to the antiferromagnetic order doubling the size of the unit cell. Although the exact result has the same feature, there is in fact no antiferromagnetic order in the chain, as we’ll see next.\n\n\n3.3 Quantum Fluctuations Degrade Antiferromagnetic Order\nIn the crudest approximation \\(s^z_j \\sim  s\\) in the ferromagnet and \\(s^z_j \\sim s(-1)^j\\) in the antiferromagnet. This corresponds to perfect order. However, the Holstein–Primakoff representation has\n\\[\ns^z_j = s - a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j.\n\\]\nHow does the second term effect \\(\\langle{0}\\rvert s^z_j \\lvert{0}\\rangle\\) in the ground state of \\(H^{(2)}\\)? In the case of the ferromagnet, it doesn’t. We know the ground state has \\(s^z = s\\) exactly. One way to see why the second term doesn’t contribute is to note that by translational invariance\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle = \\langle{0}\\rvert\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle.\n\\tag{14}\\]\nEvaluating this in terms of the normal modes gives\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^N a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left(x_j^2 + p_j^2 - 1\\right) = -\\frac{N}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_n \\left(q_n q_{-n} + \\pi_n\\pi_{-n}\\right).\n\\label{spin_DepEval}\n\\]\nThis commutes with the harmonic Hamiltonian Equation 9, and is zero in the ground state (c.f. Equation 10). In fact, this is an exact statement not restricted to the harmonic approximation: the total number of Holstein–Primakoff bosons is conserved. The same is not true for the antiferromagnetic case Equation 9. If we had written this Hamiltonian in terms of the operators \\(a^\\dagger_j\\), \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\), we would have found terms involving \\(a^\\dagger_ja^\\dagger_{j+1}\\) and \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1}\\) that create pairs of bosons (see this problem).\nNext we use the oscillator coordinates just as in Lecture 3. Since we want to express Equation 11 in terms of ladder operators, we have to adapt our definition accordingly. For \\(\\eta\\neq 0, \\pi\\) the operators\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta &= \\sqrt{\\frac{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}{2}}\\left(q_n + \\frac{i}{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}\\pi_{-n}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\na^\\dagger_\\eta &= \\sqrt{\\frac{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}{2}}\\left(q_{-n} - \\frac{i}{|\\cot(\\eta /2)|}\\pi_{n}\\right),\\qquad \\eta=2\\pi n/N\n\\label{spin_adef}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nsatisfy\n\\[\n\\sin^2(\\eta/2)q_n q_{-n} + \\cos^2(\\eta/2)\\pi_n\\pi_{-n}=\\frac{\\omega(\\eta)}{2}\\left[a^\\dagger_\\eta a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta+a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta a^\\dagger_\\eta\\right].\n\\]\nThis puts the Hamiltonian Equation 11 in the desired form, so we know that the ground state satisfies \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\eta\\lvert{\\text{GS}}\\rangle=0\\)\nTo evaluate Equation 14, we write it in terms of \\(a^\\dagger_\\eta\\), \\(a_\\eta\\) to give\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta s &= - \\langle{0}\\rvert\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N a^\\dagger_j a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\lvert{0}\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4N}\\sum_n \\left[|\\tan(\\eta_n/2)| + |\\cot(\\eta_n/2)|\\right].\\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}- \\frac{1}{4}\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi \\frac{d\\eta}{2\\pi} \\left[|\\tan(\\eta_n/2)| + |\\cot(\\eta_n/2)|\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis represents an \\(O(s^0)\\) correction to \\(\\langle s^z_j\\rangle = (-1)^j\\left(s - \\Delta s\\right)\\). However, the integral diverges logarithmically at \\(\\eta=0\\) and \\(\\eta=\\pi\\).\nThis indicates that our approach breaks down in the \\(N\\to\\infty\\) limit: at finite \\(N\\) the sums are all finite if \\(\\eta=0, \\pi\\) are excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhy can we do this? Compare with the elastic chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nRepeat the analysis on a 2D square lattice. You should find an integral over the two-dimensional Brillouin zone. Do you find divergences?\n\n\nThe breakdown of the spin wave treatment in 1D has a physical meaning: there is no long range antiferromagnetic order, even at zero temperature. The situation is closely analogous to the elastic chain, where we saw that quantum fluctuations destroyed the Bragg peaks.",

    "text": "4 A Numerical Experiment\nTo make this a bit more concrete, let’s look at the results of a brute force numerical computation of the spectrum (code).

    "text": "5 Appendix\n\n5.1 Two-Magnon states\nLet’s look at the \\(n=2\\) case. The most general state with two magnons can be written\n\\[\n\\sum_{j&gt;k} c_{j,k}s_j^-s_k^-\\lvert{\\text{FM}}\\rangle,\n\\tag{15}\\]\nwith some set of coefficients \\(c_{jk}\\). Note that \\(j=k\\) doesn’t contribute: we can’t lower the spin twice, so two magnons can’t be on the same site. Also, we don’t need to include \\(c_{j,k}=c_{k,j}\\) – magnons are bosons – so we only include \\(j&gt;k\\).\nUsing our particle picture, we might suppose that if the magnons are separated from each other they can be described by plane waves. Thus we might expect something like\n\\[\nc_{j,k}\\sim \\exp(i\\eta_1 j + i\\eta_2 k)\n\\label{spin_2Plane}\n\\]\nto work. Acting on Equation 15 with the Hamiltonian gives the eigenvalue equation for the energy \\(E = E_0 +\\epsilon\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n2c_{j,k} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_{j+1,k}+c_{j-1,k}+c_{j,k+1}+c_{j,k-1}\\right) &= \\epsilon c_{j,k},\\quad j&gt;k+1 \\nonumber\\\\\nc_{j,j-1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_{j+1,j-1}+c_{j,j-2}\\right) &= \\epsilon c_{j,j-1}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{16}\\]\nWe can think of this as a lattice analog of the two particle Schrödinger equation. The modification when \\(j=k+1\\) occurs because\n\nThere are only two bonds where the spin changes, instead of 4 when \\(j&gt;k+1\\). Thus the ‘on-site’ term is -4 not -8. This plays the role of a nearest neighbour attractive interaction between magnons.\nMagnons can’t hop on top of each other.\n\nThe first of Equation 16 is solved by\n\\[\nc_{j,k} = c_1  \\exp(i\\eta_1 j + i\\eta_2 k) + c_2  \\exp(i\\eta_1 k + i\\eta_2 j),\\quad \\text{ for } j&gt;k+1\n\\tag{17}\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\omega(\\eta_1)+\\omega(\\eta_2).\n\\]\nThe eigenvalue is thus fixed by \\(\\eta_1\\) and \\(\\eta_2\\). In turn, their possible values are determined by some quantization condition, as in the Lieb–Liniger model, but we leave this aside for the moment. First, we must use the \\(j=k+1\\) equation to determine the relationship between \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\).\nThere’s a clever way to do this. First, even though we know \\(c_{j,j}=0\\) is really zero, we extend the first of Equation 16 to \\(j=k+1\\), and this equation then involves a ‘fake’ \\(c_{j,j}\\). The advantage of this is that we can then extend the form Equation 17 to \\(j=k+1\\) and \\(j=k\\). For this to work, the correct equation for \\(j=k+1\\) – the second of Equation 16 – must be consistent with the first. This gives the condition\n\\[\n-c_{k+1,k} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_{k,k} + c_{k+1,k+1}\\right) = 0.\n\\]\nUsing the form Equation 17 gives a relationship between \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\)\n\\[\n-2\\left(c_1 e^{i\\eta_1}+c_2 e^{i\\eta_2}\\right) + (c_1+c_2)(1+e^{i(\\eta_1+\\eta_2)}),\n\\]\nwith solution\n\\[\n\\frac{c_1}{c_2} = -\\frac{e^{i(\\eta_2-\\eta_1)/2}-\\cos[(\\eta_1+\\eta_2)/2]}{e^{i(\\eta_1-\\eta_2)/2}-\\cos[(\\eta_1+\\eta_2)/2]}\\equiv e^{i\\phi},\n\\tag{18}\\]\nwhere we have defined the scattering phase shift, just as in the Lieb–Liniger model. The physical picture is therefore that a pair of magnons scatter elastically off each other, their wavefunction acquiring a phase shift as they do.\nReturning to our particle analogy, the existence of an attractive potential for magnons suggests we should allow for the possibility of bound states. Doing so requires complex \\(\\eta_{1,2}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\eta_1 = u + i v,\\quad\n\\eta_2 = u - i v,\\quad v&gt;0.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe also require that \\(c_2=0\\) in Equation 17, otherwise the eigenstate doesn’t decay. From Equation 18 we see that\n\\[\ne^{-v} = \\cos u.\n\\]\nThe total momentum of the state is \\(K=2u\\), and evaluating the energy gives\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\text{bound}(K) = \\omega(\\eta_1) + \\omega(\\eta_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\cos K).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nAs a function of momentum, compare the bound state energy with the lowest energy of two free magnons.\n\n\n\n\n5.2 The Anderson Tower\nWe consider a simple model due to Philip Anderson. The couplings of the nearest neighbour Heisenberg model on the chain, square and cubic lattices define a bipartite graph. This means that the sites (or vertices of the graph) can be grouped into two sets, with couplings only between the two sets (not within). Thus in the chain, the two sets are the even and odd sites. We call these two sets sublattice \\(A\\) and sublattice \\(B\\).\nSince it seems to be hard to solve the Heisenberg model, we simplify it in the following way (this discussion follows {% cite Lhuillier:2006aa %}). Introduce the Fourier components of the spin\n\\[\n\\mathbf{s}_\\mathbf{j} =  \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}} \\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{\\eta} e^{i \\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\cdot \\mathbf{j}}.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) denotes a \\(d\\)-dimensional vector of integers \\(\\mathbf{j}=(j_1,\\ldots j_d)\\), \\(j=1,\\ldots N\\) giving the position of the spin in an \\(\\overbrace{N\\times N \\times \\cdots N}^{d\\text{ times}}\\) cubic lattice, and likewise\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\eta} = (\\eta_1,\\ldots \\eta_d) = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}(n_1,\\ldots n_d),\\quad n_a = -N/2+1,\\ldots N/2\n\\]\ngives all the wavevectors in the Brillouin zone. It’s easier to assume \\(N\\) is even here, to accommodate antiferromagnetic order. In terms of \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\), the \\(d\\)-dimensional version of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian Equation 1 on the square / cubic / hypercubic lattice can be written\n\\[\nH = JN^d\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\in \\text{BZ}}\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{\\boldsymbol{-\\eta}},\n\\label{spin_HbergFT}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^d\\cos(\\eta_j)\\). Now we are going to do something drastic and throw away all wavevectors apart from \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}=\\boldsymbol{0}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}  = (\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)\\). The motivation is that\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_\\boldsymbol{0} = \\mathcal{N}^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B\\right), \\qquad\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{(\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)} = \\mathcal{N}^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A - \\mathbf{S}_B\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{S}_A\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S}_B\\) are the total spins of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) sublattices, and \\(\\mathcal{N}= N^d\\) is the total number of sites. Since antiferromagnetism involves anti-alignment of spins on the different sublattices, the second component should be particularly important. Our simplified Hamiltonian is then\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_{AB} &= \\frac{J}{\\mathcal{N}}\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B\\right)^2 - \\left(\\mathbf{S}_A - \\mathbf{S}_B\\right)^2\\right]\\\\\n& = \\frac{4J}{\\mathcal{N}}\\mathbf{S}_A\\cdot \\mathbf{S}_B.\n\\label{spin_HAB}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n(Note that \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{(\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)}=\\tilde{\\mathbf{s}}_{-(\\pi,\\ldots,\\pi)}\\)) Relative to the original model, this has the unphysical feature that every sublattice \\(A\\) spin is interacting with every sublattice \\(B\\) spin. The factor of \\(N^{-d}\\) does guarantee that we’ll have an extensive energy, however.\nWhat is the ground state of \\(H_{AB}\\), assuming \\(J&gt;0\\)? This is easily answered by writing the Hamiltonian as\n\\[\nH = \\frac{2J}{\\mathcal{N}} \\left[\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B\\right)^2 - \\mathbf{S}_A^2 - \\mathbf{S}_B^2\\right].\n\\tag{19}\\]\nIt’s clear that we should form two spins of maximal size \\(\\mathcal{N}/4\\) from each of the two sublattices, and then combine them to make an overall spin singlet. Obviously this singlet is a spherically symmetric state with no preferred direction, and hence no antiferromagnetic order. The ground state energy is\n\\[\nE_0 = -J\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{N}}{4}+1\\right),\n\\]\nwhich is extensive. What about the excited states? There are two options for the first excited states:\n\nStick with spins of size \\(\\mathcal{N}/4\\) for the sublattices, but combine them to make a total spin \\(S&gt;0\\).\nMake smaller spins on the sublattices, and combine them.\n\nIn the first case, the energy of excitation above the ground state is\n\\[\nE_S - E_0 = \\frac{2J}{\\mathcal{N}} S(S+1),\n\\]\nwith degeneracy \\(2S+1\\). In the second case, reducing \\(S_A\\to \\mathcal{N}/4 - 1\\) means that \\(\\Delta\\mathbf{S}_A^2 = -\\frac{\\mathcal{N}}{8}\\). From Equation 19 we see that this is going to cause the energy to increase by an amount of order \\(J\\), while in the first case our excitations were of order \\(J/\\mathcal{N}\\). The two kinds of excitations only have comparable energies when \\(S\\) is \\(O(\\sqrt{N})\\). For smaller values of \\(S\\) the “type 1” states have a lower energy\nLet’s describe the type 1 energy states in more detail. The two spins of magnitude \\(S_A = S_B = \\frac{\\mathcal{N}}{4}\\) can be combined to make a total spin between \\(\\mathcal{N}/2\\) and \\(0\\) (assuming \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) even). We can thus decompose the Hilbert space of the two spins as\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}_A\\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B = \\mathcal{H}^{(0)}\\oplus\\mathcal{H}^{(1)}\\oplus\\cdots \\mathcal{H}^{(\\mathcal{N}/2)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{H}^{(S)}\\) is the Hilbert space of a spin \\(S\\).\nNow we consider a superficially different problem: a particle of mass \\(M\\) moving on a sphere of radius \\(R\\), with Hamiltonian\n\\[\nH_\\text{rotor} = \\frac{ \\mathbf{L}^2}{2MR^2},\n\\label{spin_rotor}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}\\) is the orbital angular momentum. The eigenstates of the particle, or rotor, are spherical harmonics \\(Y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi)\\), with energy\n\\[\nE_{lm} = \\frac{L(L+1)}{2MR^2},\\qquad m=-l,\\ldots, l.\n\\]\nThus the eigenstates and eigenergies of our model spin Hamiltonian can be identified with those of the rotor up to \\(l=\\mathcal{N}/2\\). What plays the role of the direction of the rotor \\(\\mathbf{r}= R\\mathbf{n}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is a unit vector? Here are some things we know about \\(\\mathbf{n}\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{L}\\cdot \\mathbf{n} = 0,\\quad \\mathbf{n}^2 = 1\\\\\n[L_j,n_k] = i\\epsilon_{jkl}n_l,\\quad [n_j,n_k]=0.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{20}\\]\nWe get the same relations at large \\(N\\) if we make the identifications\n\\[\n\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{S}_A + \\mathbf{S}_B,\\quad \\mathbf{n} = \\frac{2}{\\mathcal{N}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_A - \\mathbf{S}_B\\right),\n\\]\nas long as we stick to \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) of \\(O(\\sqrt{\\mathcal{N}})\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nEvaluate the expressions Equation 20 and see that they are fulfilled in the limit \\(\\mathcal{N}\\to\\infty\\).\n\n\nThus the Néel vector \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) acts like the axis of a heavy rotor. Although it is certainly true that the ground state of the rotor is the \\(l=0\\) state, which is delocalized over the sphere, it is possible to form a localized state of the rotor using a superposition of the \\(l&gt;0\\) states – sometimes called the Anderson tower – which have energies that vanish as \\(\\mathcal{N}\\to \\infty\\). The dynamics of such a superposition is therefore very slow. Alternatively, we may imagine that small perturbations from the outside world lift the spherical symmetry of the problem, causing the true ground state to be localized in one direction. The strength of perturbation necessary goes to zero as \\(\\mathcal{N}\\to 0\\). In either case, the result is that a thermodynamically large system will at any instant in time be observed to be ordered in a particular direction, and that direction will change infinitesimally slowly. This situation is usually described as spontaneous symmetry breaking – not a brilliant term given the above discussion.",

    "text": "1 Creation and Annihilation Operators\nWhen we discussed the elastic chain in Lecture 3, we saw that the quanta of the normal modes of the chain could be thought of as bosons. The essence of second quantization is to turn this observation around, and formally introduce creation and annihilation operators that add and remove bosons to a system. Subsequently, we identify these operators as components of a quantum field. Whether you think of the field as a physical entity – with the bosons appearing upon quantization – or as a mathematical device for representing a system of indistinguishable particles is a question of taste. The former point of view is more common in particle physics, the latter in condensed matter.\n\n1.1 Recap: Product States\nRemember that in Lecture 1 we saw that a normalized product state of \\(N\\) bosons occupying orthonormal states \\(\\varphi_{\\alpha_n}(\\mathbf{r})\\) \\(n=1,\\ldots, N\\) is\n\\[\n\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N)=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N!\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\sum_P\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_1})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_2})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_N}),\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere the sum is over all permutations of \\(N\\) objects. The normalization factor involves the occupation numbers \\(\\{N_{\\alpha}\\}\\) giving the number of particles in state \\(\\alpha\\).\nMore generally, let’s consider the (unnormalized) symmetric product state formed from any set of single particle wavefunctions \\(\\psi_n(\\mathbf{r})\\), not necessarily orthonormal\n\\[\n\\Psi^{\\text{S}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\sum_P\\psi_1(\\mathbf{r}_{P_1})\\psi_{2}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_2})\\cdots\\psi_{N}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_N}).\n\\tag{2}\\]\nLet’s compute the inner product with another symmetric state formed from wavefunctions \\(\\phi_n(\\mathbf{r})\\)\n\\[\n\\Phi^{\\text{S}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\sum_P\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r}_{P_1})\\phi_{2}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_2})\\cdots\\phi_{N}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_N}).\n\\]\nThe result is\n\\[\n\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\Phi\\rangle = \\sum_P \\prod_{n=1}^N\\langle{\\psi_n}\\rvert\\phi_{P_n}\\rangle = \\operatorname{perm} \\langle{\\psi_m}\\rvert\\phi_{n}\\rangle,\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwhere we have introduced the permanent of the matrix \\(\\langle{\\psi_m}\\rvert\\phi_{n}\\rangle\\), which is defined just like the determinant that we met in the case of fermions, but without the minus signs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nSatisfy yourself that Equation 3 agrees with Equation 1 in the case of orthonormal single particle wavefunctions.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Creation and Annihilation Operators\nOur starting point is the vacuum state, which we’ll denote by \\(\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\) to distinguish it from the ground state. The vacuum state corresponds to the state with no particles. Up to now, we have worked with many body wavefunctions having just as many arguments as we have particles, but since we are now considering a formalism in which there are states with different numbers of particles, we have to allow for that number to be zero.\nThe creation operator \\(a^\\dagger(\\psi)\\) creates a particle in the single particle state \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\) (the reason for introducing the adjoint operator as the creation operator will become clear: for the moment let’s just take it that it’s the adjoint of something.). This means we identify\n\\[\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\longleftrightarrow a^\\dagger(\\psi)\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nMore generally, if \\(\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\) is an \\(N\\) particle state, \\(a^\\dagger(\\psi)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\) is an \\(N+1\\) particle state. Since this is orthogonal to the vacuum state\n\\[\n\\langle{\\text{VAC}}\\rvert a^\\dagger(\\psi)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle=0,\n\\]\nfor any state \\(\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\). This means, taking the adjoint\n\\[\na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\psi)\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle=0.\n\\]\nEvidently, \\(a^\\dagger(\\psi)\\) must be linear in \\(\\psi\\)\n\\[\na^\\dagger\\left(c_1\\psi_1+c_2\\psi_2\\right) = c_1a^\\dagger(\\psi_1)+c_2a^\\dagger(\\psi_2).\n\\]\nGeneralizing Equation 4, we represent an \\(N\\) particle product state Equation 2 as\n\\[\n\\Psi^{\\text{S}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N) \\longleftrightarrow a^\\dagger(\\psi_1)\\cdots a^\\dagger(\\psi_N)\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nFor this to be a symmetric wavefunction, it’s clear that we must have\n\\[\n\\left[a^\\dagger(\\psi),a^\\dagger(\\phi)\\right]=0\n\\tag{6}\\]\nfor any states \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\). Taking the adjoint gives\n\\[\n\\left[a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\psi),a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\phi)\\right]=0\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThis isn’t the only requirement however: we need to make sure that the inner product comes out right. Evaluating the inner product between two one particle states on both sides of the correspondence Equation 4 gives\n\\[\n\\langle{\\psi}\\rvert\\phi\\rangle = \\langle{\\text{VAC}}\\rvert a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\psi)a^\\dagger(\\phi) \\lvert \\text{VAC} \\rangle.\n\\]\nTo be nonzero \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\psi)a^\\dagger(\\phi)\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\) must be proportional to the vacuum state, which means \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\psi)\\) removes a particle from the system: it is an annihilation operator. To get the right value for the inner product, we impose\n\\[\n\\left[a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\psi),a^\\dagger(\\phi)\\right] = \\langle{\\psi}\\rvert \\phi \\rangle.\n\\tag{8}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that this also reproduces Equation 3.\n\n\nEquation 6, Equation 7, and Equation 8 constitute the bosonic canonical commutation relations. Via Equation 8, this representation inherits the properties of the single particle Hilbert space.\n\n\n1.3 Choosing a Basis\nBy choosing a basis for the single particle states, we choose a basis for the creation and annihilation operators. Denote an orthonormal basis by \\(\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\), with the corresponding creation and annihilation operators\n\\[\na^\\dagger(\\varphi_\\alpha)\\equiv a^\\dagger_\\alpha,\\quad a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\varphi_\\alpha)\\equiv a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\alpha.\n\\tag{9}\\]\nThen we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left[a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\alpha,a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\beta\\right]=0,\\quad \\left[a^\\dagger_\\alpha,a^\\dagger_\\beta\\right]=0,\\quad \\left[a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\alpha,a^\\dagger_\\beta\\right] = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe same relations describe the ladder operators of a set of independent harmonic oscillators, revealing a deep connection between these two systems. The state \\(\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}\\) of Equation 1 – a normalized state with \\(N_\\alpha\\) particles in state \\(\\alpha\\) – may be written\n\\[\n\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N) \\longleftrightarrow\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle \\equiv \\prod_\\alpha \\frac{\\left(a^\\dagger_\\alpha\\right)^{N_\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{N_\\alpha!}}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\n\\tag{10}\\]\nThe combination \\(\\mathsf{N}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}\\equiv a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}\\) is called the number operator for state \\(\\alpha\\) for obvious reasons\n\\[\n\\label{2nd_quant_NOp}\n    \\mathsf{N}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle=N_{\\alpha}\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle.\n\\]\nFrom Equation 9 it follows that\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\left[a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha},\\mathsf{N}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}\\right]&=a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}\\nonumber\\\\\n    \\left[a^\\dagger_{\\alpha},\\mathsf{N}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}\\right]&=-a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}.\n  \\label{2nd_quant_NaComm}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nYou can think of the first of these as “count then destroy minus destroy then count”, for example.\nSuppose we want to move to a different basis of single particle states \\(\\{\\lvert{\\tilde{\\varphi}_{\\alpha}}\\rangle\\}\\), corresponding to a unitary transformation\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_BasisChange}\n    \\lvert{\\tilde{\\varphi}_{\\alpha}}\\rangle=\\sum_{\\beta} \\langle{\\varphi_{\\beta}}\\rvert \\tilde{\\varphi}_{\\alpha} \\rangle\\lvert{\\varphi_{\\beta}}\\rangle.\n\\]\nUsing our correspondence, the one particle states with the wavefunctions \\(\\varphi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r})\\) are just \\(a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\). So we see that the above basis transformation gives a new set of creation operators\n\\[\n    \\tilde{a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}}\\equiv\\sum_{\\beta} \\langle{\\varphi_{\\beta}}\\rvert \\tilde{\\varphi}_{\\alpha} \\rangle a^\\dagger_{\\beta}.\n\\tag{11}\\]\nOften we will work in the basis of position eigenstates \\(\\{\\lvert{\\mathbf{r}}\\rangle\\}\\). In this case the matrix elements of the unitary transformation are \\(\\langle{\\varphi_{\\beta}}\\rvert \\mathbf{r} \\rangle=\\varphi^{*}_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r})\\), just the complex conjugate of the wavefunction. Denoting the corresponding creation operator as \\(\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\), Equation 11 becomes\n\\[\n\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\equiv\\sum_{\\beta}  \\varphi^{*}_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r})a^\\dagger_{\\beta}.\n\\tag{12}\\]\nNow we can see why we chose to work with the annihilation operator rather than the creation operator. The conjugate of Equation 12 is\n\\[\n\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\equiv\\sum_{\\beta}  \\varphi_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r})a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\beta},\n\\tag{13}\\]\nand involves the wavefunctions \\(\\varphi_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{r})\\), rather than their conjugates. The relations satisfied by these operators are\n\\[\n\\begin{gather}\n    \\left[\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}_1),\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right]=\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\nonumber\\\\\n    \\left[\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}_1),\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right]=\\left[\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}_1),\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right]=0.\n\\end{gather}\n\\tag{14}\\]\nThese operator-valued functions are called quantum fields. By introducing them, we have freed ourselves from many body wavefunctions. One should bear in mind that this is only a different language for talking about the same system: sometimes one language is better suited to the problem at hand; sometimes another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nIf a state \\(\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\) has wavefunction \\(\\Psi(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)\\), show that the wavefunction of the state \\(\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\) is the \\(N-1\\) particle wavefunction\n\\[\n\\sqrt{N}\\Psi(x,x_1,\\ldots, x_{N-1})\n\\tag{15}\\]\nHint: Show that this is true for a product state first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the correspondence in Equation 5 we write the state that results from acting with \\(\\psi(x)\\) on a product state as \\[\n\\psi(x)a^\\dagger(\\psi_1)\\cdots a^\\dagger(\\psi_N)\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle = \\sum_m \\psi_m(x) \\prod_{n\\neq m} a^\\dagger(\\psi_n) \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\n\\]\nwhere we used the commutation relation \\([\\psi(x),a^\\dagger(\\psi_n)]=\\langle{x}\\rvert\\psi_n\\rangle=\\psi_n(x)\\). The wavefunctions appearing on the RHS on \\(N-1\\) particle wavefunctions with arguments \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_{N-1}\\). Using Equation 5 and Equation 2 the RHS corresponds to\n\\[\n\\begin{gather}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(N-1)!}}\\sum_m \\psi_m(x) \\sum_{P\\in S_{N-1}} \\psi_{1}(x_{P_1})\\cdots \\psi_{m-1}(x_{P_{m-1}})\\psi_{m+1}(x_{P_{m}})\\cdots\\psi_{N}(x_{P_{N-1}}) \\\\\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(N-1)!}}\\sum_{P \\in S_{N}}\\psi_{1}(x_{P_1})\\psi_{2}(x_{P_2})\\cdots\\psi_{N}(x_{P_N})\n\\end{gather}\n\\]\nwith \\(x_N=x\\), and \\(S_N\\) denotes the set of permutations of \\(N\\) objects (note the change from \\(S_{N-1}\\) to \\(S_N\\) between the two lines). But this just corresponds to applying the prescription Equation 15 to the original wavefunction Equation 2. Since this works for all product states, and since any state is a superposition of product states, it works more generally.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, let our original basis be the eigenbasis of the free particle Hamiltonian \\(H=\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^{2}}{2m}\\) with periodic boundary conditions\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\label{2nd_quant_FreeParticleStates}\n    \\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle=\\frac{\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r})}{\\sqrt{V}}, \\quad \\mathbf{k}=2\\pi\\left(\\frac{n_{x}}{L_{x}},\\frac{n_{y}}{L_{y}},\\frac{n_{z}}{L_{z}}\\right),\\quad n_{x,y,z}\\text{ integer},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith \\(V=L_{x}L_{y}L_{z}\\). The matrix elements of the transformation between this original basis and the position basis \\(\\{\\lvert{\\mathbf{r}}\\rangle\\}\\) are \\(\\langle{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert\\mathbf{r}\\rangle=\\exp(-i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r})/\\sqrt{V}\\), so we have\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_PositionAnnihilation}\n    \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\exp(-i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}},\n\\]\nand similarly\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_PositionCreation}\n    \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhat is the wavefunction of the two-particle state\n\\[\n\\sum_\\mathbf{k}c_k a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle?\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n1.4 The Case of Fermions\nWe want a similar formalism for fermions, which is a bit trickier on account of those minus signs. We seek a representation of the product state\n\\[\n\\Psi^{\\text{A}}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\sum_P (-1)^P\\psi_1(\\mathbf{r}_{P_1})\\psi_{2}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_2})\\cdots\\psi_{N}(\\mathbf{r}_{P_N}).\n\\label{A_NProdAnti}\n\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is the signature of the permutation. Note that the overall sign is fixed here by the labelling of the states \\(\\psi_j\\).

    "text": "3 Representation of Operators\n\n3.1 One Particle Operators\nSuppose we now have some operator \\(A\\) that acts on the single particle states. We denote the action on \\(N\\) particle states as \\(\\hat A\\)\n\\[\n\\hat A = \\sum_{j=1}^N A_j,\n\\tag{17}\\]\nwhere the subscript denotes that the operator acts on the position label \\(\\mathbf{r}_j\\) of the \\(j^\\text{th}\\) particle. The example that we have met many times already is the Hamiltonian for noninteracting particles\n\\[\n\\hat H = \\sum_{j=1}^N H_j = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_j^2}{2m}+V(\\mathbf{r}_j)\\right].\n\\tag{18}\\]\nOperators of this type are known as one particle operators. We want to use our creation and annihilation operators to represent these operators.\nFirst, the action of the operator \\(A\\) on one of the basis states \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_\\beta}\\rangle\\) can be written in terms of the matrix elements \\(A_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\langle{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rvert A \\lvert \\varphi_\\beta \\rangle\\) by inserting a resolution of the identity \\(\\sum_\\alpha \\lvert{\\alpha}\\rangle\\langle{\\alpha}\\rvert=1\\) on the right \\[\nA\\lvert{\\varphi_\\beta}\\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rvert A \\lvert \\varphi_\\beta \\rangle = \\sum_\\alpha A_{\\alpha\\beta}\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle.\n\\]\nThe same thing may be expressed slightly differently by inserting resolutions of the identity on the left and right \\[\nA= \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta} \\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rvert A \\lvert \\varphi_\\beta \\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\beta}\\rvert = \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta} A_{\\alpha\\beta}\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\beta}\\rvert.\n\\]\nTherefore, the action of \\(\\hat A\\) on the product state \\(\\lvert{\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle\\) is \\[\n\\hat A \\lvert{\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2}\\cdots\\beta_{N}}}\\rangle = \\sum_\\alpha \\left[A_{\\alpha\\beta_1}\\lvert{\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\alpha\\beta_{2}\\cdots\\beta_{N}}}\\rangle +A_{\\alpha\\beta_2}\\lvert{\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\beta_1\\alpha\\cdots\\beta_{N}}}\\rangle+\\cdots A_{\\alpha\\beta_N}\\lvert{\\Psi^{\\text{S}}_{\\beta_1\\beta_{2}\\cdots\\alpha}}\\rangle\\right]\n\\tag{19}\\]\nNow we argue that the same job is done by\n\\[\n\\hat A = \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta}A_{\\alpha\\beta}a^\\dagger_\\alpha a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\beta\n\\]\nacting on the state \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle\\). Indeed, we have\n\\[\n\\left[a^\\dagger_\\alpha a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\beta,a^\\dagger_\\gamma\\right]=a^\\dagger_\\alpha\\delta_{\\beta\\gamma}\n\\tag{20}\\]\nBy commuting \\(a^\\dagger_\\alpha a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\beta\\) though each of the creation operators in\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle \\equiv \\prod_\\alpha \\frac{\\left(a^\\dagger_\\alpha\\right)^{N_\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{N_\\alpha!}}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\n\\]\nwe reproduce the action Equation 19. As a simple example,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\label{2nd_quant_}\n    \\mathop{\\hat A}a^\\dagger_{\\beta}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle&=\\left(\\left[\\mathop{\\hat A},a^\\dagger_{\\beta}\\right]+a^\\dagger_{\\beta}\\mathop{\\hat A}\\right)\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\\n                            &=\\sum_{\\alpha} A_{\\alpha \\beta} a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe second quantized form of \\(\\hat A\\) allows us to find the matrix element \\(\\langle{\\mathbf{N}}\\rvert \\hat A \\lvert \\mathbf{N'} \\rangle\\) between product states made of orthonormal single particle states. This vanishes unless \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{N'}\\) differ by the movement of of one particle. If \\(N_\\beta = N'_\\beta-1\\) and \\(N_\\alpha = N'_\\alpha+1\\) we have\n\\[\n\\langle{\\mathbf{N}}\\rvert \\hat A \\lvert \\mathbf{N'} \\rangle = A_{\\alpha\\beta} \\sqrt{N_\\alpha N'_\\beta}.\n\\tag{21}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nThis formula is not so easy to work out in the first quantized representation. Try it!\n\n\nWe worked this out for the bosonic case. However, you can check that Equation 20, the basic relation that makes it all work, is also valid for fermions (as a commutation relation, note!). So \\(\\hat A\\) has the same form for fermions.\nNotice that \\(\\mathop{\\hat A}\\) looks formally like the expectation value of \\(\\mathop{A}\\) in a single particle state \\(\\sum_{\\alpha}a_{\\alpha}\\lvert{\\varphi_{\\alpha}}\\rangle\\). The difference, of course, is that the \\(a_{\\alpha}\\) in \\(\\mathop{\\hat A}\\) are operators, so that the order is important, while those in the preceding expression are amplitudes. The replacement of amplitudes, or wavefunctions, by operators is the origin of the rather clumsy name second quantization, which is traditionally introduced with the caveat that what we are doing is not in any way ‘more quantum’ than before.\nTo repeat the above prescription for emphasis: A one particle operator \\(\\mathop{\\hat A}\\) has a second quantized representation formally identical to the expectation value of its single particle counterpart \\(\\mathop{A}\\).\nThis probably all looks a bit abstract, so let’s turn to a one particle operator that we have already met, namely the noninteracting Hamiltonian in Equation 18. According to the above prescription, this should have the second quantized form\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_H2ndQ}\n    \\mathop{\\hat H} \\equiv \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\langle{\\varphi_{\\alpha}}\\rvert \\mathop{H} \\lvert \\varphi_{\\beta} \\rangle a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\beta},\n\\]\nwhere \\(H\\) is the single particle Hamiltonian \\(H=-\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla_{i}^{2}+V(\\mathbf{r_{i}})\\). This takes on a very simple form if the basis \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{\\alpha}}\\rangle\\) is just the eigenbasis of this Hamiltonian, in which case \\(\\langle{\\varphi_{\\alpha}}\\rvert \\mathop{H} \\lvert \\varphi_{\\beta} \\rangle=E_{\\alpha}\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}\\) and\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathop{\\hat H} \\equiv \\sum_{\\alpha} E_{\\alpha} a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}=\\sum_{\\alpha} E_{\\alpha} \\mathsf{N}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{22}\\]\nEvidently this is correct: the eigenstates of this operator are just the \\(N\\) particle basis states \\(\\lvert{\\Psi^{S/A}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots \\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle\\), with eigenvalues \\(\\sum_\\alpha N_\\alpha E_\\alpha\\).\nAlternatively, we can look at things in the position basis. By recalling how the expectation value of the Hamiltonian looks in this basis, we come up with\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\mathop{\\hat H}&=\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\left[-\\frac{1}{2m}\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\nabla^{2}\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})+V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\n                    &=\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\left[\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\cdot\\nabla\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})+V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\right],\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{23}\\]\nwhere in the second line we have integrated by parts, assuming that boundary terms at infinity vanish. The equality of Equation 23 and Equation 22 may be seen by using Equation 13.\nThe Heisenberg equation of motion corresponding to Equation 23 is\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\label{2nd_quant_HeomFree}\n    \\begin{split}\n    i\\partial_{t}\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r},t) &= -\\left[\\mathop{\\hat H},\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right]\\\\\n    &= -\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla^{2}\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r},t)+V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r},t),\n    \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhich is just the time dependent Schrödinger equation!\nAs a second example, consider the particle density. This is not something that one encounters very often in few particle quantum mechanics, but is obviously an observable of interest in a extended system of many particles. The one particle operator for the density at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_spDens}\n    \\rho(\\mathbf{x})\\equiv\\delta(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{r}).\n\\]\nThis may look like a rather strange definition, but its expectation value on a single particle state \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\) is just \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x})=\\lvert{\\varphi(\\mathbf{x})}\\rvert^{2}\\), which is just the probability to find the particle at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Following our prescription, the second quantized form of the operator is then\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_2ndQDens}\n    \\hat\\rho(\\mathbf{x})\\equiv\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{x}).\n\\]\nAs a check, integrating over position should give the total number of particles\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_DensIntegral}\n    \\hat N=\\int d\\mathbf{x}\\, \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{\\alpha} a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{a}=\\sum_{\\alpha}\\mathsf{N}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha},\n\\]\nas it does! Another useful thing to know is the expectation value of the density on a basis state \\(\\lvert{N_{0},N_{1}\\ldots}\\rangle\\)\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_DensityExp}\n    \\langle{N_{0},N_{1}\\ldots}\\rvert  \\hat\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\lvert N_{0},N_{1}\\ldots \\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha} N_{\\alpha}\\left|\\varphi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r})\\right|^{2}.\n\\]\nwhich is most easily proved by substituting the representation Equation 13. This seems like a very reasonable generalization of the single particle result: the density is given by sum of the probability densities in each of the constituent single particle state, weighted by the occupancy of the state. Note that the symmetry of the states played no role here.\nAs a final example of a one particle operator, the particle current has the second quantized form\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_current}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}(\\mathbf{r})=-i\\frac{1}{2m}\\left[\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\left(\\nabla\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\right)-\\left(\\nabla\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\right)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\right].\n\\]\nOften we consider the Fourier components of the density or current\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\label{2nd_quant_FourierComp}\n    \\hat\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}}\\equiv\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, \\hat\\rho(\\mathbf{r})e^{-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}/2}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}/2}\\nonumber\\\\\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}_{\\mathbf{q}}\\equiv\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}(\\mathbf{r})e^{-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{m}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}/2}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}/2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe \\(\\mathbf{q}=0\\) modes are just the total particle number and \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\) times the total momentum, respectively.\nIn Lecture 1 we introduced the single particle density matrix\n\\[\n    g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}') \\equiv N \\int d\\mathbf{r}_{2}\\cdots d\\mathbf{r}_{N}\\,\\Psi^{*}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_{N})\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}',\\mathbf{r}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_{N}).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that this can be written in terms of our field operators as\n\\[\n\\label{2nd_quant_SPDensity}\ng(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')= \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}') \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle.\n\\]\n\n\nNotice that \\(g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r})=\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\hat\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\\). A slight generalization of the above calculation for the density gives for the state \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle\\)\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_SPFock}\n    g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}') = \\sum_{\\alpha} N_{\\alpha}\\varphi_{\\alpha}^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\varphi^{}_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{r}').\n\\]\nIn Lecture 1 we evaluated \\(g(x,y)\\) for the ground state of a 1D Fermi gas using the Slater determinant form of the wavefunction. For variety, let’s calculate it using our new method for the 3D Fermi gas. Recall that in this case \\(N_{\\mathbf{k}}=1\\) for \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert&lt;k_{F}\\), and \\(0\\) otherwise. Thus the ground state can be written\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\text{Fermi sea}}\\rangle = \\prod_{|\\mathbf{k}|&lt;k_F} a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{2nd_quant_FermiDensityMatrix}\ng(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')=\\frac{1}{V}\\sum_{|\\mathbf{k}|&lt;k_{F}} e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r})}&=\\int_{|\\mathbf{k}|&lt;k_{F}} \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^{3}}\\,e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r})}\\nonumber\\\\\n&=\\frac{k_{F}^{3}}{2\\pi^{2}}\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\left(k_{F}|\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r}|\\right)}{(k_{F}|\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r}|)^{3}}-\\frac{\\cos\\left(k_{F}|\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r}|\\right)}{(k_{F}|\\mathbf{r}'-\\mathbf{r}|)^{2}}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that \\(g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{k_{F}^{3}}{6\\pi^{2}}=n\\), as it should. Also, \\(g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')\\to 0\\) as \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'}\\rvert\\to\\infty\\).\n\n\nContrast this calculation with the wavefunction version.\n\n\n\n3.2 Two Particle Operators\nA two particle operator acts pairwise on the particles\n\\[\n\\hat B = \\sum_{j&lt;k} B_{jk}.\n\\tag{24}\\]\nNote that \\(B_{jk}=B_{kj}\\) for indistinguishable particles, and that \\(j=k\\) is excluded. The most important two particle operator that we will encounter describes interactions between pairs of particles, usually of the form \\[\n\\hat H_\\text{int.} = \\sum_{j&lt;k} U(\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_k).\n\\tag{25}\\]\nSimilar to the single particle case, the action of \\(\\hat B\\) on a two particle product state \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{\\alpha}}\\rangle_1\\lvert{\\varphi_{\\beta}}\\rangle_2\\) can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements \\[\n\\begin{align}\nB_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta} &= \\langle{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rvert\\langle{\\varphi_\\beta}\\rvert B_{12} \\lvert{\\varphi_\\gamma}\\rangle\\lvert{\\varphi_\\delta}\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\\n&=\\int d\\mathbf{r}d\\mathbf{r}' \\varphi_\\alpha^*(\\mathbf{r})\\varphi_\\beta^*(\\mathbf{r}')B_{12}\\varphi_\\gamma(\\mathbf{r})\\varphi_\\delta(\\mathbf{r}')\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that since \\(B_{12}=B_{21}\\) we have \\(B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}=B_{\\beta\\alpha,\\delta\\gamma}\\). In the first quantized representation we have \\[\nB_{12} = \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\lvert{\\varphi_\\beta}\\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\gamma}\\rvert\\langle{\\varphi_\\delta}\\rvert.\n\\] Now we’ll argue that the second quantized representation of \\(\\hat B\\) is \\[\n\\hat B = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}a^\\dagger_\\alpha a^\\dagger_\\beta a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\delta a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\gamma.\n\\tag{26}\\]\n(Note the order, which is important for fermions!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nCheck that Equation 26 has the correct action on product states, starting with the two particle state\n\\[\na^\\dagger_\\gamma a^\\dagger_\\delta\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\longleftrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\varphi_\\gamma(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\gamma(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right]\n\\] For example, in the first quantized picture we have \\[\n\\begin{align}\nB_{12}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\varphi_\\gamma(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\gamma(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\right]&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta}\\left[B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}\\pm B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\delta\\gamma}\\right]\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\beta(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\end{align}\n\\] Note that this is (anti-)symmetric for bosons (fermions) by virtue of \\(B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}=B_{\\beta\\alpha,\\delta\\gamma}\\). In second quantized notation the resulting state is written \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta}\\left[B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}\\pm B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\delta\\gamma}\\right]\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\beta(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\longleftrightarrow\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta}B_{\\alpha\\beta}a^\\dagger_\\alpha a^\\dagger_\\beta\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\n\\] Which is the same as we get if we act with Equation 26 \\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta cd} B_{\\alpha\\beta,cd}a^\\dagger_\\alpha a^\\dagger_\\beta a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_da^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_c\\right)a^\\dagger_\\gamma a^\\dagger_\\delta\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle=\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta}B_{\\alpha\\beta}a^\\dagger_\\alpha a^\\dagger_\\beta\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle.\n\\] Make sure to trace down factor of 2!\n\n\nThe analog of the formula Equation 21 for the matrix elements of a two particle operator between two product states is \\[\n\\langle{\\mathbf{N}}\\rvert \\hat B \\lvert \\mathbf{N'} \\rangle =\\left[B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\delta}\\pm B_{\\alpha\\beta,\\delta\\gamma}\\right] \\sqrt{N_\\alpha N_\\beta N'_\\gamma N'_\\delta},\n\\label{A_Babcd}\n\\] with \\(N_{\\gamma,\\delta} = N'_{\\gamma,\\delta}-1\\) and \\(N_{\\alpha,\\beta} = N'_{\\alpha,\\beta}+1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nStrictly this formula is not correct when \\(\\gamma=\\delta\\) or \\(\\alpha=\\beta\\). In the former case \\(N'_\\gamma N'_\\delta \\to N'_\\gamma (N'_\\gamma-1)\\) and in the latter \\(N_\\alpha N_\\beta \\to N_\\alpha (N_\\alpha-1)\\). In the thermodynamic limit these terms usually make a vanishing contribution when sums are replaced with integrals. There are exceptions: when a finite fraction of the particles are in one state (which occurs for Bose—Einstein condensates, for example). In those cases we end up neglecting \\(N_\\alpha-1\\) relative to \\(N_\\alpha\\), however!\n\n\nReturning to the interaction Equation 25, we can express this operator in the position basis as\n\\[\n\\hat H_\\text{int.} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, U(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}_1).\n\\]\nRemembering that \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\), this is almost the same as\n\\[\n\\hat H_\\text{int.} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, U(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\rho(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\tag{27}\\]\nThe difference lies in the order of the operators, which prevents a particle from interacting with itself. Operators in which all annihilation operators stand to the right of all creation operators are said to be normal ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nCheck that Equation 27 has a zero expectation value in a 1 particle state.\n\n\nAs an example, let’s write the Hamiltonian of interacting bosons that we met in Lecture 1 in our new formalism. \\[\nH = \\int dx \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_x\\psi^\\dagger(x)\\partial_x\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x) + \\frac{c}{2}\\psi^\\dagger(x)\\psi^\\dagger(x)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)\\right],\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)\\), \\(\\psi^\\dagger(x)\\) satisfy the canonical bosonic commutation relations Equation 14.\nWe’ve succeeded in translating an interacting many body Hamiltonian into a quantum field theory. But we shouldn’t feel too smug. As I said earlier, this is a change of language, and its usefulness is not guaranteed. The same warning applies to alternative formulations of the same problem: as a functional integral, for example. In the case of the Lieb–Liniger model, the exact solution was best presented in the first quantized, many body wavefunction framework. Ditto for the Laughlin states of the fractional quantum Hall effect. However, in approximate treatments of many body problems that we can’t solve exactly, like the Bose gas in higher dimensions that we’ll discuss in Lecture 8, the second quantized framework is often a good starting point.",

    "text": "4 Appendix: Alternative Derivation of One- and Two-particle Operators\nHere we give simpler derivation of the general form of one- and two- particle operators using the form Equation 15 for the action of the field operator \\(\\psi(x)\\), which applies in both the bosonic and fermionic cases\n\n4.1 One particle operators\nWe show that the one-particle operator \\(\\hat A\\) in Equation 17 has the representation\n\\[\n\\hat A = \\int \\psi^\\dagger(x_1) [A_{x_1} \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}({x_1})]\\, d{x_1}\n\\]\nwhere the subscript on \\(A_{x}\\) is to indicate that the operator acts on the field operator \\(\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)\\) as if it were a wavefunction e.g. the momentum operator acts as \\(p \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)=-id\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)/dx\\).

In the presence of a strong magnetic field, charged particles confined to move in the plane can form a series of new states of matter with bizarre properties. Fortunately, our understanding of this menagerie is based almost entirely on many body wavefunctions of a rather simple form.\nThe quantum Hall effect refers to quantization of the Hall conductivity \\(G_{xy}= \\frac{I_x}{V_y}\\) into integer multiples of the conductance quantum \\(e^2/h\\). This phenomenon is obvserved in two dimensional electon gases at low temperatures in a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. Some years after its discovery, the fractional quantum Hall effect was observed, with \\(G_{xy} = \\nu e^2/h\\), with \\(\\nu\\) taking simple fractional values \\(\\nu=1/3, 2/5\\), etc..\nThese fractional values are only the tip of an iceberg of remarkable phenomena, indicating that the electrons are reorganizing into a bewildering variety of exotic states of matter, characterized by excitations with fractional charge and statistics outside the boson / fermion dichotomy discussed earlier. Even more surprisingly, our understanding of these phases rests largely on guessing the right wavefunction to describe these strongly interacting systems. How is such a thing possible? As we’ll see below, the wavefunction is in fact strongly constrained by the presence of the magnetic field.\nReading: Girvin (2002), Stone (1992).",

Identical arguments to those used in discussing the Fermi gas on the ring then tell us that the ground state wavefunction of \\(N\\) fermions is \\[\n\\Psi(z_1,\\ldots, z_N) = \\prod_{j&lt;k}^N (z_j-z_k) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{j=1}^N\\left|z_j\\right|^2\\right)\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the density is \\[\n\\rho_1(z,\\bar z) = \\frac{e^{-|z|^2/2}}{2\\pi}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\left|z\\right|^{2n}}{2^n n!} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(N,|z|^2/2)}{(N-1)!}.\n\\tag{5}\\] Here \\(\\Gamma(s,x) = \\int^\\infty_x t^{s-1}e^{-t}dt\\) is the incomplete gamma function.\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity of particles in the LLL for \\(N=100\\)\n\n\nAt small \\(\\left\\|z\\right\\|\\), we can approximate the sum in Equation 5 by extending the upper limit to \\(\\infty\\), and we have \\(\\rho_1\\to \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\).

    "section": "3 The Laughlin Wavefunction",
    "text": "3 The Laughlin Wavefunction\nThe theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect begins with Robert Laughlin’s famous wavefunction Laughlin (1983) generalizing Equation 4 \\[\n\\Psi_m(z_1,\\ldots, z_N) = \\prod_{j&lt;k}^N (z_j-z_k)^{m} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{j=1}^N\\left|z_j\\right|^2\\right).\n\\tag{6}\\] For this wavefunction to describe fermions, \\(m\\) must be odd. Even \\(m\\) describes bosons. I want to emphasize first that despite the superficial similarity of Equation 4 and Equation 6, they are very different beasts. While Equation 4 is an (antisymmetric) product state Equation 6 is not, and indeed its expansion in product states is not known in general. Furthermore, the excitations formed by modifying this state have remarkable properties. As the abstract to Laughlin’s paper puts it:\n\nThis Letter presents variational ground-state and excited-state wave functions which describe the condensation of a two-dimensional electron gas into a new state of matter.\n\nHowever, we’ll see that the \\(m=1\\) an \\(m&gt;1\\) cases do have some common features. First, we should try and explain where these wavefunctions came from. Conceptually, the simplest case to discuss is that of bosons interacting via the repulsive potential \\[\nH_{\\text{int}} = g\\sum_{j&lt;k}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_k),\\qquad g&gt;0\n\\tag{7}\\] The Laughlin state Equation 6 with \\(m=2\\) has zero interaction energy. In fact, any state with zero interaction energy must have \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) as a factor. But if a wavefunction has a higher degree, then in the presence of the potential Equation 3 it will have a higher energy than \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\). Thus \\(\\Psi_2(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) is the ground state.\nLaughlin argued that for electrons with Coulomb interaction \\(\\Psi_{m}(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\) with \\(m\\) odd is a good variational wavefunction. The fact that \\((z_j-z_k)\\) appears in a power higher than one means that the particles tend to stay away from each other more than in the \\(m=1\\) state, thus lowering their interaction.\nTo get more precise information about the behaviour of wavefunctions, Laughlin introduced a powerful analogy between the probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi_m(z_1,\\ldots, z_N)\\rvert^2\\) of the particles, and the Boltzmann distribution of particles in a classical 2D plasma. Before doing that, it’s useful to actually ‘look’ at a typical configuration of particles.\n\n\n\nComparison of Monte Carlo samples from an uncorrelated (uniform) distrubution of points (left) vs. the Laughlin probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi_3(z_1,\\ldots z_N)\\rvert^2\\) (right).\n\n\nThe striking feature of the right hand picture is the uniformity of the particle distribution, in contrast with the sample of uncorrelated particles on the left. The plasma analogy helps us to understand this, and a lot more.",

This observation is Laughlin’s plasma analogy. Do bear in mind that we are not talking about physical electrostatic fields – this is a mathematical identification of two probability distributions.\nOf course, we still have to analyze the statistical mechanical problem, which is hard to do exactly. Since we are interested in the large \\(N\\) limit, we can introduce a continuum charge density \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) and write the electrostatic energy as a functional of \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) as \\[\n\\beta V[\\rho] = -m\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}\\, d^2\\mathbf{r}'\\, \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|\\rho(\\mathbf{r}') + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}\\, \\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|^2\\rho(\\mathbf{r}).\\\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that minimizing the energy with respect to \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) – corresponding to finding the most likely configuration – leads to the condition \\[\n-2m\\int d^2\\mathbf{r}'\\, \\log\\left|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'\\right|\\rho(\\mathbf{r}') + \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|^2 = 0.\n\\]\nShow that applying \\(\\nabla^2\\) to both sides gives \\[\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi m}.\n\\]\n\n\nOn the basis of this approximation, we conclude that the density is fixed at \\(1/m\\) of the value we found for the \\(m=1\\) case, which seems reasonable. The result applies where the density is non-zero, so we get a uniform droplet as before, this time of radius \\(\\sqrt{2Nm}\\). \\(1/m\\) is called the filling fraction of the state.\nAlthough we ignored the effect of summing over all configuration of the particles in the partition function (i.e. we ignored the contribution of entropy to the free energy), it turns out that this effect can be ignored in the large \\(N\\) limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nOne odd thing about the above calculation is that if the charge density is uniform, how does the droplet know where to sit? The location of the origin is obviously dictated by the minimum of the quadratic term in the energy, but we could have located that anywhere in the plane and still had a uniform charge density.

The concept of a quasiparticle is one that we’ll meet repeatedly in this course. It describes a particle-like excitation of a many body system. Phonons – quantized lattice vibrations – are a kind of quasiparticle that you will have met before. In quantum field theory, particles themselves are described as quantized excitations of a system – fields that pervade spacetime – so at a formal level there is little difference between the particles of particle physics and the quasiparticles of condensed matter physics. The physical difference is that in the latter case we know what the background medium is made of!\nLet’s see how the plasma picture is modified by the introduction of the quasihole.

In practical terms, this means that for a small time step \\(\\Delta t\\) we update the position as\n\\[\n\\Delta \\mathbf{r}_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta t}{m}}(X_i, Y_i)  + \\mathbf{v}\\Delta t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(X_t\\) and \\(Y_t\\) are sampled from a standard normal distribution of unit variance: \\(X_t, Y_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\)\nExtended to the many body case and applied to the Laughlin wavefunction Equation 6 we arrive at the drift \\(\\mathbf{v}_i\\) of particle \\(i\\), written in terms of the positions \\(\\mathbf{r}_i = (x_i, y_i)\\)\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}_i = -\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{r}_i + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{r}_i \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + m \\sum_{j\\neq 1} \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j - (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j)\\times \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}{|\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{r}_j|^2}\\right).\n\\]\nThis is what I used for the Monte Carlo simulation of the Laughlin state.",

    "text": "1 Correlation Functions\nIn Lecture 1 we introduced the pair distribution function\n\\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = N(N-1) \\int dx_3\\ldots dx_N \\,\\left|\\Psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\right|^2,\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhich measures the likelihood of finding a pair of particles at \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). We also saw that \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\) could be related to the expectation of the product of the density operators \\(\\rho(x)\\) at different points.\n\\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x_1)\\rho(x_2)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle - \\rho_1(x_1)\\delta(x_1-x_2),\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho_1(x)= \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\rho(x) \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\\). \\(\\rho_2(x,y)\\) is the simplest example of a correlation function. Note also that the quantity \\(\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\rho_q \\rho_{-q} \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\), used to quantify the crystalline order in a solid in Lecture 3, is just the Fourier transform of \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\). Higher correlation functions, involving products of more than two density operators, provide more detailed information on the distribution of the particles.\n\n1.1 Correlation Functions in Second Quantization\nWe evaluated \\(\\rho_2(x,y)\\) for the 1D Fermi gas:\n\\[\n\\rho_2(x,y) = n^2\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sin[k_\\text{F}(x-y)]}{k_\\text{F}(x-y)}\\right)^2\\right].\n\\tag{3}\\]\nLet’s see how to reproduce this result using second quantization. \\(\\rho_2(x,y)\\) can be written in second quantized notation as\n\\[\n\\rho_2(x,y) =\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\psi^\\dagger(x)\\psi^\\dagger(y)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(y)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x) \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to get this formula is to use the correspondence that we found in Lecture 5 \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle&\\longleftrightarrow \\Psi(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)\\nonumber\\\\\n\\psi(X)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle&\\longleftrightarrow \\sqrt{N}\\Psi(X,x_1,\\ldots, x_{N-1})\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nShow that Equation 1 implies Equation 4.\n\n\nEquation 4 differs from \\(\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x)\\rho(y)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\) by the ordering of operators. Using the canonical commutation relations for the fields gives the relation Equation 2 for both bosons and fermions.\nLet’s evaluate Equation 4 for the ground state of the Fermi gas. We will find the result for a general product state, using the same strategy as we used in the last lecture for the single particle density matrix. That is, we substitute the expansion of the fields \\(\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)\\) and \\(\\psi^\\dagger(x)\\) in terms of the orthonormal single particle states making up the product state\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(x)=\\sum_{\\beta}  \\varphi^{}_{\\beta}(x)a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\beta},\\nonumber\\\\\n  \\psi^\\dagger(x)=\\sum_{\\beta}  \\varphi^*_{\\beta}(x)a^\\dagger_{\\beta}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis gives\n\\[\n    \\label{2nd_quant_CEval}\n    \\rho_2(x,y)=\\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta}\\varphi^{*}_{\\alpha}(x)\\varphi^{*}_{\\beta}(y)\\varphi^{}_{\\gamma}(y)\\varphi^{}_{\\delta}(x)\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}a^\\dagger_{\\beta}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\gamma}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\delta} \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle.\n\\]\nIf we are considering the expectation in a state of the form \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle\\), we can see that an annihilation operator for a given single particle state must be accompanied by a creation operator for the same state. There are therefore two possibilities\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    &\\alpha =\\delta,\\, \\beta=\\gamma, \\text{ or }\\nonumber\\\\\n  &\\alpha=\\gamma,\\, \\beta=\\delta,\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhich give rise to two groups of terms\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle{\\mathbf{N}}\\rvert a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}a^\\dagger_{\\gamma}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\gamma}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha} \\lvert \\mathbf{N} \\rangle&=N_{\\alpha}N_{\\gamma}\\nonumber\\\\\n    \\langle{\\mathbf{N}}\\rvert a^\\dagger_{\\alpha}a^\\dagger_{\\gamma}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\alpha}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\gamma} \\lvert \\mathbf{N} \\rangle&=\\pm N_{\\alpha}N_{\\gamma}\\qquad\\text{if }\\alpha\\neq\\gamma,\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nthe \\(\\pm\\) corresponding to bosons and fermions respectively. Thus we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_2(x,y)=\\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta}N_\\alpha N_\\beta\\left[\\lvert{\\varphi_{\\alpha}(x)}\\rvert^2\\lvert{\\varphi_{\\beta}(y)}\\rvert^2 \\pm \\varphi^*_\\alpha(x)\\varphi^{}_\\alpha(y)\\varphi^*_\\beta(y)\\varphi^{}_\\beta(x) \\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nYou might notice that this expression weights the case \\(\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma=\\delta\\) by a factor \\(2N_\\alpha^2\\) when it should have \\(N_\\alpha(N_\\alpha-1)\\) in the case of bosons, and zero for fermions. On the other hand, such cases amount to a sum over a single index, where the general case is a sum over a double index. It seems reasonable, then, that this accounting error is not important in the thermodynamic limit. For instance, in the case that \\(\\varphi_\\alpha(x)\\) are plane wave states we have the usual prescription\n\\[\n\\sum_\\alpha(\\cdots) \\longrightarrow L\\int (\\cdots)\\frac{dk}{2\\pi},\n\\]\nassuming the integrand is smooth. In this case the error in Equation 5 is a factor of \\(L^{-1}\\) smaller than what we retain. We do however have to be careful in Bose condensates, where one state has a finite fraction of the particles and this argument does not apply.\nWe can express the result Equation 5 in terms of the density and density matrix as\n\\[\n\\rho_2(x,y) = \\rho_1(x)\\rho_1(y) \\pm g(x,y)g(y,x),\n\\tag{6}\\]\nwhich, in the case of the ground state of the Fermi gas, reproduces Equation 3. We see that the correlation function vanishes as the separation \\(x-y\\to 0\\), because \\(g(x,x)=\\langle\\mathop{\\rho(y)}\\rangle\\). This is, of course, another manifestation of the exclusion principle: it is not possible for two fermions to sit on top of each other. The scale of the ‘hole’ in the correlation function is of course set by the mean interparticle separation, or Fermi wavelength. Note also the decaying oscillations, indicating liquid-like correlations in the positions of the particles. These are sometimes known as Friedel oscillations.\n\n\n\nCorrelation function \\(\\rho_2(x,0)\\) for the Fermi gas.\n\n\nFor bosons the situation is very different. If \\(g(x,y)\\to 0\\) as \\(\\lvert{x-y}\\rvert\\to\\infty\\), the value of the correlation function as \\(\\lvert{x-y}\\rvert\\to 0\\) is twice the value at \\(\\lvert{x-y}\\rvert\\to\\infty\\). This characteristic behavior is often termed bunching: a pair of bosons is more likely to be found at two nearby points than at two distant points.\nNothing about the result Equation 6 is special to 1D of course: one just has to recalculate the density and density matrix. Remember, though, that it does only apply to product states.\n\n\n1.2 The Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect\nThe result for the density correlations Equation 5 or Equation 6 can be viewed as a kind of interference effect that shows up in the correlations of the intensity of a quantum waves, even when there is no interference in the intensity itself. To illustrate this interpretation, we consider a classic experiment from with Bose condensates described in Andrews et al. (1997).\nConsider a gas of \\(N\\) noninteracting bosons occupying the lowest energy level of some potential well: a Bose condensate. If the ground state wavefunction is \\(\\varphi_{0}(\\mathbf{r})\\), the \\(N\\)-body wavefunction for such a state is\n\\[\n    \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N)=\\prod_i^N \\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r}_i),\n  \\label{2nd_quant_BoseGroundState}\n\\]\nwhich we can write in second quantized notation as\n\\[\n    \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\left(a^\\dagger_0\\right)^N\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\n\\]\nwhere \\(a^\\dagger_0\\) creates a particle in the state \\(\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})\\). Imagine that we took another well, also filled with \\(N\\) bosons, and placed it alongside the first. If we switch off the potentials at some instant, the particles will fly out, with wavefunctions orginating in the two wells overlapping. Precisely this experiment was reported in Andrews et al. (1997). What do we expect to see?\nLet us denote by \\(\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r})\\) the ground states of two spatially separated potential wells. First, consider a state where each boson is in a superposition of \\(\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r})\\). Such a situation could arise by starting from a single well and adiabatically splitting it in two. We can write such a state as\n\\[\n    \\lvert{\\bar N_L,\\bar N_R}\\rangle_\\theta\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar N_L}{N}}e^{-i\\theta/2}\n    a^\\dagger_L+\\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar N_R}{N}}e^{i\\theta/2}a^\\dagger_R\\right]^N\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\n  \\label{more_two}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar N_{L,R}\\) are the expectation values of particle number in each state \\(N=\\bar N_L+\\bar N_R\\). We allow the system to evolve for some time \\(t\\), so that the two `clouds’ begin to overlap (typically achieved by allowing free expansion i.e. turning off the confining potentials). If we consider the time evolution in the Heisenberg picture then, as we saw last time, the field operator obeys the free particle Schrödinger equation (ignoring interactions)\n\\[\ni\\frac{\\partial \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r},t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla^2\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r},t).\n\\]\nWe write the field operator as\n\\[\n\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})=\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r},t)a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_L+\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r},t)a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_R+\\cdots,\n\\]\nwhere the wavefunctions \\(\\varphi_{L/R}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\) are evolving freely, and the dots denote the other states in some complete orthogonal set that includes \\(\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r})\\): we can ignore them because they are empty. A calculation of the expectation value of \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})=\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\) gives\n\\[\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\rho_1(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\bar N_L|\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2+\\bar N_R|\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2+\\overbrace{2\\sqrt{\\bar N_L \\bar\n    N_R}\\mathrm{Re}\\,e^{i\\theta}\\,\\varphi^*_L(\\mathbf{r},t)\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r},t)}^{\\equiv\\rho_{\\mathrm{int}(\n    \\mathbf{r},t)}}.\n    \\end{align}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nIf the clouds begin to overlap, the last term in Equation 7 comes into play. Its origin is in quantum interference between the two coherent subsystems, showing that the relative phase has a real physical effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nConsider a Gaussian wavefunction of width \\(R_0\\) at time \\(t=0\\). Show (by substitution into the Schrödinger equation is fine) that this function evolves as\n\\[\n\\varphi(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\frac{1}{\\left(\\pi R_t^{2}\\right)^{3/4}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\mathbf{r}^2\\left(1+i t/m R_0^2)\\right)}{2R_t^2}\\right],\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nR_t^2=R_0^2+\\left(\\frac{ t}{mR_0}\\right)^2.\n\\]\n\n\nEquation 8 illustrates a very important point about the expansion of a gas. After a long period of expansion, the final density distribution is a reflection of the initial momentum distribution. This is simply because faster moving atoms fly further, so after time \\(t\\) an atom with velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) will be at position \\(\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{v}t\\) from the center of the trap, provided that this distance is large compared to \\(R_{0}\\), the initial radius of the gas. The \\(t\\to\\infty\\) limit of Equation 8 gives\n\\[\n        |\\varphi(\\mathbf{r},t\\to\\infty)|^{2}\\propto \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{m R_{0}\\mathbf{r}}{ t}\\right)^{2}\\right],\n    \\label{2nd_quant_TimeOfFlight}\n\\]\nreflecting a Gaussian initial momentum distribution of width \\(R_0^{-1}\\). Imaging the density distribution after expansion is one of the most commonly used experimental techniques in ultracold physics, and yields information about the momentum distribution \\(n(\\mathbf{p})\\equiv  a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}}\\) before expansion.\nConsider the evolution of two Gaussian wavepackets with width \\(R_0\\) at \\(t=0\\), separated by a distance \\(d\\gg R_0\\)\n\\[\n    \\varphi_{L,R}(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\frac{1}{\\left(\\pi R_t^{2}\\right)^{3/4}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\pm\\mathbf{d}/2\\right)^2\\left(1+i t/m\n    R_0^2)\\right)}{2R_t^2}\\right],\n\\]\nThe final term of Equation 7 is then\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\rho_{\\mathrm{int}}(\\mathbf{r},t)&=A(\\mathbf{r},t)\\cos\\left[\\theta+\\frac{\\mathbf{r}\n    \\cdot\\mathbf{d}}{mR_0^2R_t^2}t\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\n    A(\\mathbf{r},t)&=\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\bar N_L\\bar N_R}}{\\pi^{3/2}R_t^3}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{r}^2+\\mathbf{d}^2/4}{R_t^2}\\right)\n\\label{int_term}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe interference term therefore consists of regularly spaced fringes, with a separation at long times of \\(2\\pi t/md\\).\nNow we imagine doing the same thing with two condensates of fixed particle number, which bear no phase relation to one another. The system is described by the product state (often called a Fock state in this context)\n\\[\n    \\lvert{N_L,N_R}\\rangle\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_L! N_R!}}\\left(a^\\dagger_L\\right)^{N_L}\\left(a^\\dagger_R\\right)^{N_R}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle.\n\\]\nComputing the density in the same way yields\n\\[\n    \\rho_1(\\mathbf{r},t)=N_L|\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2+N_R|\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r},t)|^2,\n\\label{dens_fock}  \n\\]\nwhich differs from the previous result by the absence of the interference term.\nThis is not the end of the story, however. When we look at an absorption image of the gas, we are not looking at an expectation value of \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) but rather the measured value of some observable(s) \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\). The expectation value just tells us the result we would expect to get if we repeated the same experiment many times and averaged the result. We get more information by thinking about the correlation function of the density at two different points.\nAn application of our result Equation 5 for the density correlations gives\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\rho_2(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')&=\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}')\n    +N_LN_{R}\\varphi_L^*(\\mathbf{r})\\varphi_R^*(\\mathbf{r}')\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r}')\\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r}) \\nonumber\\\\\n    &\\qquad+N_{L}N_R\\varphi_R^*(\\mathbf{r})\\varphi_L^*(\\mathbf{r}')\n    \\varphi_R(\\mathbf{r}')\\varphi_L(\\mathbf{r}).\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nWe see that the second line contains interference fringes, with the same spacing as before. The correlation function gives the relative probability of finding an atom at \\(\\mathbf{r}'\\) if there is one at \\(\\mathbf{r}\\). We conclude that in each measurement of the density, fringes are present but with a phase that varies between measurements, even if the samples are identically prepared.\n\n\n\nFringes observed by interfering two Bose condensates (Source: Andrews et al. (1997))\n\n\nThe rather surprising implication is that predictions for measured quantities for a system in a Fock state are the same as in a relative phase state, but with a subsequent averaging over the phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nProve this by showing that the density matrix\n\\[\n\\rho=\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi}\\lvert{\\bar N_L,\\bar N_R}\\rangle_\\theta\\langle{\\bar N_R,\\bar N_L}\\rvert_\\theta\n\\]\ncoincides with that of a mixture of Fock states with binomial distribution of atoms into states \\(\\varphi_{L}\\), \\(\\varphi_{r}\\). At large \\(N\\) this distribution becomes sharply peaked at occupations \\(\\bar N_L\\), \\(\\bar N_R\\).\n\n\nThe interference of two independent condensates was observed in 1997 in Andrews et al. (1997). The related question of whether two independent light sources give rise to interference was discussed much earlier in Magyar and Mandel (1963). The occurrence of interference fringes in a correlation function does not depend upon Bose condensation, although the phenomenon is very striking in this case because the fluctuations are parametrically as large as the \\(\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}')\\) term in Equation 9. The general phenomenon is known as the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, which is the work of two people (not three): Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss. For the history and early applications of this effect, see Baym (1999) and Kleppner (2008).",

This expression lies at the core of the variational Hartree–Fock method for many body systems, which approximates the ground state by a product state. The Hartree term looks completely reasonable, while the Fock potential doesn’t look like a potential at all, and reflects the non-classical correlations.\n\n\n2.2 Hartree–Fock for the Electron Gas\nHow does the Hartree–Fock picture change when we have spin? Let’s consider a system of spin-1/2 fermions.

An spin-independent interaction potential is described by a Hamiltonian of the form\n\\[\n\\hat H_\\text{int.} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2}\\int d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, U(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^\\dagger_{\\sigma_1}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\psi^\\dagger_{\\sigma_2}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\sigma_2}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\sigma_1}(\\mathbf{r}_1).\n\\]\nThe Hartree–Fock energy is then\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\langle \\hat H_\\text{int.}\\rangle &=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, d\\mathbf{r}'\\, \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) U(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\\rho(\\mathbf{r}')\\nonumber\\\\\n    &- \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, d\\mathbf{r}'\\,  U(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\\tr\\left[g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')g(\\mathbf{r}',\\mathbf{r})\\right].\n  \\label{2nd_quant_HFSpin}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe Fock term can be rewritten in a more useful way using the identity\n\\[\n\\delta_{ab}\\delta_{cd} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{a c}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{d b} + \\delta_{ac}\\delta_{db}\\right].\n\\tag{10}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nOne way to understand Equation 10 is to to think of the two Pauli matrices as acting on two spin 1/2s (as we did in Lecture 4, in which case we can work in the basis \\(\\lvert{s_1}\\rangle\\lvert{s_2}\\rangle\\) and we have\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_1\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_2+ \\mathbb{1}_1\\mathbb{1}_2 = 2\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] The matrix elements of the right hand side are then \\(2\\delta_{s_1,s_2'}\\delta_{s_2,s_1'}\\).\n\n\nwhich gives\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{\\text{Fock}} &=-\\frac{1}{4} \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, d\\mathbf{r}'\\,  U(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\\tr\\left[g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')\\right]\\tr\\left[g(\\mathbf{r}',\\mathbf{r})\\right]\\nonumber\\\\&-\\frac{1}{4}\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, d\\mathbf{r}'\\,  U(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\\tr\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}g(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')\\right]\\cdot\\tr\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}g(\\mathbf{r}',\\mathbf{r})\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSuppose we had a \\(\\delta\\)-function interaction \\(U(\\mathbf{r})=V_0 \\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\). Then the Fock energy can be written\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{\\text{Fock}} =-\\frac{V_0}{4} \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, \\rho(\\mathbf{r})^2-V_0\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, \\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{r})\\cdot\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{r})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe second term favours ferromagnetism for repulsive interactions. The physical origin is the same as the Hund’s rule coupling in atoms: fermions in different spin states can sit at the same spatial location, while those in the same spin state must be in different locations. For repulsive interactions occupying the same spin state is energetically favourable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nThis is most succintly put by the formula\n\\[\n\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho(\\mathbf{r})^2 - 2\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{r})\\cdot\\mathbf{s}(\\mathbf{r})\n\\]\n\n\nThe Hartree–Fock energy forms the basis of a variational method using product states as variational wavefunctions. For a Hamiltonian with translational invariance, like\n\\[\nH = \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla\\psi^\\dagger\\cdot\\nabla\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{r}d\\mathbf{r}' U(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}')\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}')\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}),\n\\tag{11}\\]\nthis is not too bad, as we are guaranteed to be working with plane wave single particle states. Then the only variational parameters are the occupancies of these states: we’ll meet an example in the next section. If translational symmetry is broken by introducing a potential \\(U(\\mathbf{r})\\) into the single particle part of Equation 11, say, the situation is more complicated. We may be tempted to use single particle states that are the eigenstates of the single particle part of the Hamiltonian, but there is no real justification for this, and one has to allow the states, as well as the occupancies, to vary.\n\n\n2.3 Stoner Criterion for Ferromagnetism\nLet us try to put a bit more flesh on the idea that repulsive interactions favour ferromagnetism in fermionic systems. We will continue to use the model interaction \\(U(\\mathbf{r})=V_0\\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\) that we introduced in the previous section. Of course, this isn’t a realistic interaction between electrons in a metal, say, but as we’ll see in Lecture 11, the long-ranged Coulomb interaction is screened and becomes finite-ranged. Thus our model is not a bad approximation to the effective interaction between electrons in a metal.\nPolarizing the spins in a Fermi gas is not without cost (otherwise everything would be ferromagnetic!): there is a price to pay in increased kinetic energy. To understand why this is so, consider the ground state kinetic energy of \\(N\\) (spinless) fermions in three dimensions, obtained from\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nN = \\sum_{|\\mathbf{k}|&lt;k_\\text{F}} 1 &\\longrightarrow L^3 \\int_{|\\mathbf{k}|&lt;k_\\text{F}} \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} = \\frac{k_\\text{F}^3 L^3}{6\\pi^2} \\nonumber\\\\\nE_\\text{kin} = \\sum_{|\\mathbf{k}|&lt;k_\\text{F}} \\frac{\\mathbf{k}^2}{2m} &\\longrightarrow L^3 \\int_{|\\mathbf{k}|&lt;k_\\text{F}} \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{\\mathbf{k}^2}{2m}\\\\\n&= \\frac{k_\\text{F}^5 L^3}{20\\pi^2 m} = L^3 \\frac{3}{10m}(6\\pi^2)^{2/3} n^{5/3},\\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n(The assumption of a quadratic dispersion is not important here. More generally, we fill a band structure.) where \\(n = \\frac{N}{L^3}\\) is the mean density. Assuming a system of fermions with spin is now polarized in the \\(z\\)-direction, we have differing densities \\(n_{\\uparrow,\\downarrow}\\) of spin up and spin down fermions. Their total energy is\n\\[\nE_\\text{kin}(n_\\uparrow,n_\\downarrow) = \\frac{cL^3}{m}\\left(n_\\uparrow^{5/3}+n_\\downarrow^{5/3}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(c=\\frac{3}{10}(6\\pi^2)^{2/3}\\). In terms of the overall density \\(n=n_\\uparrow+n_\\downarrow\\) and density of spin \\(\\bar s = \\left(n_\\uparrow-n_\\downarrow\\right)/2\\), we have\n\\[\nE_\\text{kin}(n, \\bar s) = \\frac{cL^3}{m}\\left(\\left[n/2+\\bar s\\right]^{5/3}+\\left[n/2-\\bar s\\right]^{5/3}\\right).\n\\]\nAlternatively, write this in terms of the polarization \\(P \\equiv \\frac{n_\\uparrow-n_\\downarrow}{n}\\) that varies in the range \\([-1,1]\\) as\n\\[\nE_\\text{kin}(P) = \\frac{E_\\text{K}}{2}\\left[(1+P)^{5/3}+(1-P)^{5/3}\\right].\n\\]\nWe see that, on account of the convexity of \\(x^{5/3}\\), \\(E^{(0)}_\\text{kin}(n, \\bar s)\\) is minimized for \\(s=0\\).\nLet’s compare this with the effect of interactions. In the short-ranged model introduced above, the total Hartree–Fock energy is\n\\[\nE_\\text{HF}(n,\\bar s) = \\frac{V_0L^3}{2} n^2 - \\frac{V_0L^3}{2} \\left(n_\\uparrow^2+n_\\downarrow^2\\right) =  \\frac{V_0L^3}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}n^2 - 2\\bar s^2\\right).\n\\]\nWe write this in terms of the polarization as\n\\[\nE_\\text{HF}(P) = \\frac{E_V}{2}(1-P^2).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nMinimize the total energy \\(E(P) = E_\\text{kin}(P) + E_\\text{HF}(P)\\) to show\n\nFor \\(E_V/E_K&lt;10/9\\) the ground state is non-magnetic.\nAs \\(E_V/E_K\\) increases past \\(10/9\\) the magnetization begins to increase.\nAt \\(E_V/E_K&gt;\\frac{5}{6}2^{2/3}\\) is the ground state is fully polarized.\n\n\n\nOne shouldn’t take these numerical values too seriously given the simplicity of the model, but they illustrate the physical principles at work behind the appearance of ferromagnetism in metals.\n\n\n2.4 Excited State Energies\nSo far we have discussed properties of the ground state only. We can, however, evaluate the Hartree–Fock energy in a product state describing an excited state of a noninteracting system. This gives the first order perturbation theory correction to the excited state energy. For concreteness we will stick with fermions for now, though the method is general.\nIf we work in a translationally invariant system, the appropriate single particle states are plane waves. We write the field operators in the plane wave basis as\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r})\\equiv\\frac{1}{L^{3/2}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}},\\nonumber\\\\\n  \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r})\\equiv\\frac{1}{L^{3/2}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\exp(-i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nand represent the interaction potential in terms of its Fourier components\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}') = \\frac{1}{L^3}\\sum_\\mathbf{q}\\tilde U(\\mathbf{q}) \\exp(i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot[\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}']).\n\\]\nThe interaction Hamiltonian for spinless particles can then be written\n\\[\n\\hat H_\\text{int.}  = \\frac{1}{2L^3} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}_4} \\tilde U(\\mathbf{k}_1-\\mathbf{k}_4) a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_1}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_2}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_3}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_4}.\n\\tag{12}\\]\nWhen written in this way, interaction Hamiltonians are sometimes associated with the graphical representation below, one of the ingredients of the Feynman diagram technique for performing perturbation theory calculations in field theories. The incoming lines (arrows in) represent particles being removed (in momentum states \\(\\mathbf{k}_3\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}_4\\)) and the outgoing lines represent particles added (momenta \\(\\mathbf{k}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}_2\\)). The wiggly line represents \\(\\tilde V(\\mathbf{q})\\). The conservation of momentum at the vertices is a consequence of the translational invariance of the problem: the two integrations over \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{r}'\\) give rise to two \\(\\delta\\)-functions that perform this function.\n\n\n\nGraphical representation of the interaction Equation 12.\n\n\nAs we’ve already discussed, the expectation value of Equation 12 in a product state of momentum eigenstates gives two terms, with different ‘pairings’ of creation operators with annihilation operators. We can represent these two terms graphically as shown below.\n\n\n\nGraphical representation of the Hartree and Fock terms.\n\n\nEvaluating the two contributions in terms of the occupation numbers gives\n\\[\n\\langle{\\mathbf{N}}\\rvert \\hat H_\\text{int.} \\lvert \\mathbf{N} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2V}\\tilde U(0) \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}_1,\\mathbf{k}_2} N_{\\mathbf{k}_1}N_{\\mathbf{k}_2} - \\frac{1}{2V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}_1,\\mathbf{k}_2} \\tilde U(\\mathbf{k}_1-\\mathbf{k}_2) N_{\\mathbf{k}_1}N_{\\mathbf{k}_2}\n\\]\nWhile the Hartree term just depends on the total number of particles, the Fock term depends on the individual occupations. The interaction energy to add a single particle to state \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) is\n\\[\n\\Delta U_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{\\tilde U(0)}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}'} N_{\\mathbf{k}'} - \\frac{1}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}'} \\tilde U(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}') N_{\\mathbf{k}'}\n\\]",

    "text": "1 The Gross–Pitaevskii Approximation\nOur first attack on the problem is variational. It’s very easy to come up with a variational wavefunction for the ground state of a Bose gas: put all the particles in the same single particle state!\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N) = \\prod_{j=1}^N \\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r}_i)= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\left(a^\\dagger(\\varphi_0)\\right)^N\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nA state with a macroscopic number of particles in a single particle state is known as a Bose condensate. You have probably studied the statistical mechanics of an ideal Bose gas before: the main feature is a condensation temperature below which macroscopic occupation occurs.\nWe know that if we have a noninteracting Hamiltonian\n\\[\nH = \\sum\\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^2}{2m} + V(\\mathbf{r}_i)\\right],\n\\]\nthen the ground state has exactly the form Equation 1, with \\(\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})\\) the ground state of the single particle Hamiltonian. After adding interactions to the Hamiltonian, in the form\n\\[\nH_\\text{int.} = \\sum_{j&lt;k} U(\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{r}_1 d\\mathbf{r}_2\\, U(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}(\\mathbf{r}_1).\n\\]\nit is no longer true that the exact ground state has the form Equation 1, but we can treat \\(\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})\\) as a variational function that we must find. This leads to the Gross–Pitaevskii equation.\n\n1.1 Gross–Pitaevskii Equation\nFrom now on we will take a model of short-ranged interactions for simplicity\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}') = U_0\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')\n\\]\nTo implement the variational calculation we need to find\n\\[\n\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle}{\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\Psi \\rangle}\n\\]\nIn fact, it turns out to be more convenient to minimize \\(\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\\), using a Lagrange multiplier to fix the normalization. We have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle=N \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\left[\\frac{1}{2m}|\\nabla\\varphi_0|^2+V(\\mathbf{r})|\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n\\right]\\\\\n+\\frac{1}{2}N(N-1)U_0\\int d\\mathbf{r}|\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})|^4.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFor large \\(N\\), we can neglect the difference between \\(N\\) and \\(N+1\\). Now we want to extremize this functional with respect to \\(\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})\\), keeping \\(\\varphi_{0}(\\mathbf{r})\\) normalized. To do this we introduce a Lagrange multiplier \\(\\mu N\\) (the factor of \\(N\\) will become clear shortly) and extremize the functional\n\\[\n\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle - \\mu N \\int d\\mathbf{r}|\\varphi_{0}(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}.\n\\]\nTo find the extremum requires a standard application of the calculus of variations, yielding the equation\n\\[\n    \\left[-\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla^2-\\mu+V(\\mathbf{r})+NU_0|\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})|^2\\right]\\varphi_0(\\mathbf{r})=0.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIt’s convenient to deal with the stray factor of \\(N\\) in Equation 3 by defining \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\equiv\\sqrt{N}\\varphi_{0}(\\mathbf{r})\\). \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\) is known as the condensate wavefunction or order parameter. Later we will give a more general definition that does not depend on the above variational approximation. We have thus obtained the Gross–Pitaevskii equation\n\\[\n\\left[-\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla^2-\\mu+V(\\mathbf{r})+U_0|\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})|^2\\right]\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})=0.\n\\]\nIt remains to fix the Lagrange multiplier \\(\\mu\\). This is done by demanding that \\(\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\,\\lvert{\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}\\rvert^{2}=N\\). Since \\(\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle- \\mu \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\lvert{\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}\\rvert^{2}=\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H-\\mu \\mathsf{N} \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\\) was extremized under general variations, including those that changed \\(N\\), we must have\n\\[\n    \\label{bose_static_GPmu}\n    \\mu=\\frac{\\partial\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle}{\\partial N},\n\\]\nso that \\(\\mu\\) is identified with the chemical potential.\nA fundamental effect of the nonlinearity of the GP equation is that there exists a length scale set by the typical value of \\(|\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})|^2\\sim n\\) and the interaction strength\n\\[\n\\xi\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2m n U_0}}\n\\]\nThis healing length determines the scale over which \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\) is disturbed by the introduction of a localized potential of scale \\(\\ll \\xi\\). It is a fundamental length scale in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that near a hard wall, where the condensate wavefunction goes to zero, \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\) is given by \\[\n\\varphi(x)=\\varphi_{\\infty}\\tanh \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\xi}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) is the distance from the wall, and \\(\\varphi_{\\infty}=\\sqrt{n_{\\infty}}\\) is fixed by the density of the condensate far from the wall.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Some Observables\nWith the ansatz Equation 1 for the wavefunction, we can obtain various observables without difficulty. The density and current density are\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r})&=|\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})|^2,\\\\\n\\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r})&=-\\frac{i}{2m}\\left[\\varphi^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\left(\\nabla\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\right)-\\left(\\nabla\\varphi^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\right)\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAlternatively, one may write this is terms of the velocity field of the gas, using \\(\\mathbf{j}=\\rho \\mathbf{v}\\), and the decomposition of \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\) into magnitude and phase\n\\[\n    \\varphi(\\mathbf{r})=\\sqrt{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}e^{i\\chi(\\mathbf{r})}.\n\\]\nWe thus find the superfluid velocity\n\\[\n    \\mathbf{v}_{s}\\equiv\\frac{1}{m}\\nabla\\chi.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nThe name is to distinguish this contribution from that arising from thermal excitations. For the moment we are considering zero temperature, so this is all there is.\nThe usefulness of the Gross–Pitaevskii equations lies in its ability to describe spatially nonuniform situations. Often, nonuniformity is imposed by an external potential, but there is an important class of configurations that are stable – or metastable – for topological reasons.\n\n\n1.3 Example: Vortex\nSince Equation 4 tells us that the superfluid velocity is a gradient of something, we may expect it to be irrotational\n\\[\n\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{v}_s = 0,\n\\]\nor equivalently to have vanishing circulation\n\\[\n\\oint \\mathbf{v}_s\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}=0\n\\]\naround any closed loop. However, it is possible for the phase of the wavefunction to increase by a multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) around a closed loop, which still gives a single-valued condensate wavefunction since \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})=\\sqrt{\\rho(\\mathbf{r})}e^{i\\chi(\\mathbf{r})}\\). Thus in general the circulation\n\\[\n\\oint \\mathbf{v}_s\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}=\\frac{2\\pi \\ell}{m},\\quad \\ell\\in\\mathbb{Z},\n\\]\nwhich is known as the Onsager–Feynmann quantization condition. A localized configuration with finite circulation is called a vortex in fluid dynamics, but in a normal fluid there is no reason for the vorticity to be quantized. Restoring Planck’s constant just this once\n\\[\n\\oint \\mathbf{v}_s\\cdot d\\mathbf{l}=\\frac{h\\ell}{m},\\quad \\ell\\in\\mathbb{Z},\n\\]\nshows that this is a truly quantum phenomenon.\nA non-zero winding of the phase requires that \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\) vanishes at a point (in two dimensions) or on a line (in three). Let’s see how such configurations are described by the Gross–Pitaevskii theory.\nWe are going to look for 2D solutions where the phase winds \\(\\ell\\) times as we encircle the origin\n\\[\n\\varphi(r,\\theta)\\xrightarrow{r\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{n} e^{i\\ell\\theta}.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nWe parameterize the solution as \\(\\varphi(r,\\theta) = \\sqrt{n} f(r/\\xi)e^{i\\ell\\theta}\\), measuring distances in terms of the healing length. Substituting into the Gross–Pitaevskii equation gives an equation in \\(s\\equiv r/\\xi\\).\n\\[\n-f'' -\\frac{f'}{s} + \\frac{\\ell^2 f}{s^2} - f +f^3 =0.\n\\]\nWe take \\(\\mu = U_0 n\\) to get the behaviour Equation 5 at infinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWithout finding the solution explicitly, show that \\(f(s)\\sim s^\\ell\\) for small \\(s\\), and \\(f(s\\to\\infty) \\to 1\\).\n\n\nThe region of suppressed density, of characteristic size \\(\\xi\\), is called the vortex core. In three dimensions, the vortex core is a line.\nWe can find the energy of the vortex state by substituting the solution back into the energy functional Equation 2 to find the energy excess relative to a uniform state of density \\(n\\)\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\left[\\frac{n^2}{2m\\xi^2}(f')^2+\\frac{U}{2}n^2 \\left(f^2-1\\right)^2\\right] + \\frac{n^2}{2m}\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\, f^2(\\nabla\\chi)^2.\n\\]\nThe first integral is finite, and arises purely from the departure of the density away from its bulk value. The second represents the contribution to the kinetic energy arising from the winding of the vortex’s phase. Since we have\n\\[\n\\nabla \\chi = \\frac{\\ell}{r}\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta,\n\\]\nthis contribution to the energy is logarithmically divergent.\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\text{const.} + \\frac{\\pi n \\ell^2}{m}\\log\\left(\\frac{L}{\\xi}\\right).\n\\]\nThere is far-reaching analogy between the superfluid velocity fields of vortices and the magnetostatics of current-carrying wires,\n\n\n\nVortices\nMagnetostatics\n\n\n\n\nVortex cores\nWires\n\n\nSuperfluid velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_s\\)\nMagnetic field, \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)\n\n\nKinetic Energy\nMagnetostatic Energy\n\n\n\nVortices with \\(\\lvert{\\ell}\\rvert&gt;1\\) are generally unstable, and will break into multiple vortices of winding \\(\\ell=\\pm 1\\).

The true ground state of the system does not have such flows, of course, so these flows are only metastable (as long as rotational symmetry is broken, so that angular momentum is not conserved). In the case of the vortex, it can only decay by its core leaving the system. An even simpler example is provided by currents flowing in a ring, a situation studied in Problem Set 2, which illustrates the important role played by repulsive interactions.",

    "text": "2 Bogoliubov Theory\nHow can we improve upon the Gross–Pitaevskii approximation? From now on we focus on a uniform condensate with no external potential \\(V(\\mathbf{r})\\), in which case the condensate wavefunction is just a constant \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})=\\sqrt{n}\\). As usual we work in a plane wave basis, where the Hamiltonian takes the form\n\\[\nH =\\sum_\\mathbf{k}\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}+ \\overbrace{\\frac{U_0}{2V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}_4} a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_1}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_2}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_3}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_4}}^{\\equiv H_\\text{int}},\n\\]\nwith \\(\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})=\\mathbf{k}^2/2m\\), and \\(V\\) the volume.

Remembering that\n\\[\na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\lvert{N}\\rangle = \\sqrt{N}\\lvert{N-1}\\rangle,\\quad a^\\dagger\\lvert{N}\\rangle = \\sqrt{N+1}\\lvert{N+1}\\rangle,\n\\label{bose_aN}\n\\]\nwe see that a term in the Hamiltonian with \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0\\) or \\(a^\\dagger_0\\) is going to be more important – on account of the large occupancy of \\(\\mathbf{k}=0\\) – than a term without. For this reason we divide up the interaction Hamiltonian according to the number of occurrences of these operators\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\text{int} = &\\frac{U_0}{2V}a^\\dagger_0a^\\dagger_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0 \\\\\\nonumber\n&+\\frac{U_0}{2V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\neq0}\\left[a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{0}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{0} + a^\\dagger_{0}a^\\dagger_{0}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{k}}+4a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\right]\\\\\\nonumber\n&+\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\substack{\\mathbf{k}_1=\\mathbf{k}_2+\\mathbf{k}_3\\\\ \\mathbf{k}_{1,2,3}\\neq 0}}\\left[a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_3}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_2}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_1}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0 +a^\\dagger_0a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_1}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_2}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_3}\\right]\\\\\\nonumber\n&+\\frac{U_0}{2V}\\sum_{\\substack{\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}_4\\\\ \\mathbf{k}_{1,2,3,4}\\neq 0}} a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_1}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_2}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_3}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_4}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe Gross–Pitaevskii approximation corresponds to the first term. We are now going to additionally keep the second term, and neglect the third and fourth. Thus we study the Hamiltonian\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\text{pair} &= \\sum_\\mathbf{k}\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}+\\frac{U_0}{2V}a^\\dagger_0a^\\dagger_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0 \\nonumber\\\\ &\\quad+\\frac{U_0}{2V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\neq0}\\left[a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{0}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{0} + a^\\dagger_{0}a^\\dagger_{0}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{k}}+4a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe second line describes the movement of pairs between zero momentum and \\((+\\mathbf{k},-\\mathbf{k})\\). To separate as much as possible the \\(\\mathbf{k}\\neq 0\\) modes from the \\(\\mathbf{k}=0\\) mode we use\n\\[\na^\\dagger_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0 = N - N',\\quad N'\\equiv \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\neq 0} N_\\mathbf{k}\n\\]\nso that\n\\[\na^\\dagger_0a^\\dagger_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0 =  N(N-1) - 2N'N_0+O(N_0^0   ).\n\\]\nIn this way, Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\text{pair} = &N\\epsilon(0)+\\frac{U_0}{2V}N(N-1) \\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber\n&+\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\neq 0}\\left(\\left[\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})-\\epsilon(0)\\right]a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\right.\\\\\n&\\left.+\\frac{U_0}{2V}\\left[a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{0}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{0} + a^\\dagger_{0}a^\\dagger_{0}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{k}}+2a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\right]\\right).\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nEven though \\(\\epsilon(0)=0\\) for the situation we are interested in right now, we have included the general case in Equation 7 to emphasize that it is the energy difference between \\(0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) that is important: any energy offset appears as a constant in the first term.\nEven now it’s not so easy to solve this problem. One last vital simplification is needed. We are going to replace the operators \\(a^\\dagger_0\\), \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0\\) with \\(\\sqrt{N}\\), giving a quadratic Hamiltonian. That may sound like a pretty odd thing to do: after all, the resulting Hamiltonian no longer conserves the number of particles! Let’s see why this is a good approximation.\nConsider the action of the Hamiltonian Equation 6 on a product state of the form \\(\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\otimes\\lvert{N_0}\\rangle_0\\), where \\(\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\) lives in the many body Hilbert space made from non-zero momentum single particle states and \\(\\lvert{N_0}\\rangle_0\\) has \\(N_0\\) particles in the zero momentum state.\nThe action of \\(a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0\\) on this state is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\otimes\\lvert{N_0}\\rangle_0 &= \\left(a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\right)\\otimes a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_0\\lvert{N_0}\\rangle_0\\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\left(a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\right)\\otimes \\sqrt{N_0}\\lvert{N_0-1}\\rangle_0.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nLikewise\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_0\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\otimes\\lvert{N_0}\\rangle_0 &= \\left(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\right)\\otimes a^\\dagger_0\\lvert{N_0}\\rangle_0 \\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\left(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\lvert{\\Psi'}\\rangle\\right)\\otimes \\sqrt{N_0+1}\\lvert{N_0+1}\\rangle_0.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince \\(N_0\\) is assumed to be large, we ignore the difference between \\(N_0\\) and \\(N_0+1\\). To be more precise, we are assuming that in the states we are going to find, \\(N_0\\) will not fluctuate substantially. If this is the case, the matrix elements of \\(H_\\text{pair}\\) are approximately unchanged when we make the replacement mentioned above, leaving us with the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_\\text{pair} &= N\\epsilon(0)+\\frac{U_0}{2V}N(N-1) \\nonumber\\\\\n&+\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\neq 0}\\left(\\left[\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})+U_0n_0\\right]a^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}+\\frac{U_0n_0}{2}\\left[a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}} + a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\right]\\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere \\(n_0 = N_0/V\\) is the density of particles in the zero momentum state, and we have defined \\(\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})\\equiv\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})-\\epsilon(0)\\). The Hamiltonian Equation 8 can be diagonalized by a Bogoliubov transformation.\n\n\n2.2 Bogoliubov transformation\nThis is a change of variables that arises often in many body physics, so we’ll take some time to introduce it in a general context. Suppose we have a Hermitian operator that is quadratic in two bosons \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,2}\\) with the following form\n\\[\nh = \\epsilon\\left[a^\\dagger_1a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1+a^\\dagger_2a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_2\\right] + \\delta\\left[a^\\dagger_1a^\\dagger_2+a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_2\\right].\n\\]\nIt’s convenient to write this as\n\\[\nh = \\begin{pmatrix}\na^\\dagger_1 & a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\epsilon & \\delta \\\\\n\\delta & \\epsilon\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1 \\\\ a^\\dagger_2\n\\end{pmatrix}-\\epsilon\n\\]\nIt is possible to express \\(h\\) in terms of some new bosons \\(b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,2}\\) in the form\n\\[\nh = \\Omega\\left[b^\\dagger_1b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1+b^\\dagger_2b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_2\\right] +\\text{const.}\n\\]\n(because then the spectrum is obvious). We look to express the new bosons linearly in terms of the old as follows\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nb^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1 \\\\ b^\\dagger_2\n\\end{pmatrix}=\n\\Lambda\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1 \\\\ a^\\dagger_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Lambda\\) is some \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix. What conditions should \\(\\Lambda\\) satisfy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that if we want the new bosons \\(b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,2}\\) to satisfy the same commutation relations as the original \\(a_{1,2}\\), we must have \\[\n\\Lambda^\\dagger \\sigma_3 \\Lambda = \\sigma_3\n\\]\n\n\nThe following parameterization satisfies this condition and is sufficiently general for our needs\n\\[\n\\Lambda=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cosh\\kappa & \\sinh\\kappa \\\\\n\\sinh\\kappa & \\cosh\\kappa\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nNotice the differences from a rotation matrix:\n\nHyperbolic instead of trignometric functions\nNo sign difference between the off digaonal elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\tanh 2\\kappa = \\frac{\\delta}{\\epsilon},\\qquad \\Omega = \\sqrt{\\epsilon^2-\\delta^2\\nonumber}\\\\\nh = \\Omega\\left[b^\\dagger_1b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1+b^\\dagger_2b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_2\\right] + \\Omega - \\epsilon.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe form of \\(\\Omega\\) is most easily understood by noting that the transformation preserves the determinant (\\(\\det\\Lambda=1\\)).\n\nWhat happens if \\(\\delta&gt;\\epsilon\\)?\nWhat changes if \\(\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\epsilon & \\delta \\\\\n\\delta & \\epsilon\n\\end{pmatrix}\\longrightarrow \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\epsilon_1 & \\delta \\\\\n\\delta & \\epsilon_2\n\\end{pmatrix}\\)?\n\n\n\nApplying the same logic to our Hamiltonian ?@eq-HY gives\n\\[\nb^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}=a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}\\cosh\\kappa_\\mathbf{p}+a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}}\\sinh\\kappa_\\mathbf{p}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\qquad \\tanh2\\kappa_\\mathbf{p}=\\frac{n_0 U_0}{\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})+n_0 U_0},\n\\]\n(make sure you understand where the \\(1/2\\) went!) and\n\\[\nH=E_0+\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}\\neq 0}\\omega(\\mathbf{p})b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}\nb^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}.\n\\]\nHere \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{p})\\) is the Bogoliubov dispersion relation\n\\[\n\\omega(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sqrt{\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})\\left(\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})+2U_0n_0\\right)},\n\\]\nand the ground state energy is\n\\[\nE_0=\\frac{1}{2}nU_0  N+\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}\\neq 0}\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\omega(\\mathbf{p})-\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})-n_0U_0\\right].\n\\]\nSomewhat annoyingly, this integral is divergent in the ultraviolet. However, this is actually nothing to do with the many body physics of the problem, but is rather related to the need to regularize a \\(\\delta\\)-function potential in three dimensions (see Problem Set 2. The cure is described in the Appendix, but it isn’t too important in what follows.\n\n\n2.3 The Ground State\nSo far, our ground state is just defined by the condition that it is a vacuum of Bogoliubov excitations\n\\[\nb^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\lvert{0}\\rangle=\\left(\\cosh\\kappa_\\mathbf{k}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}+\\sinh\\kappa_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\right)\\lvert{0}\\rangle=0.\n\\]\nBut what does it look like? A state (unnormalized) that satisfies the above equation is\n\\[\n\\lvert{0}\\rangle=\\prod_{\\mathbf{k}\\neq 0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\tanh\\kappa_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{k}}\\right)\\lvert{\\Psi_\\text{GP}}\\rangle\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow this. If you’ve seen coherent states before, remember that the state \\(e^{\\alpha a^\\dagger}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\) is an eigenstate of \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\nThe form Equation 9 shows explicitly that the state consists of a superposition of pairs excited out of the \\(\\mathbf{k}=0\\) condensate. As we’ve discussed, we don’t actually keep track of the loss of particles from the condensate in the Bogoliubov approximation, on the assumption that it is small.\nWe can get some feeling for the properties of the ground state by considering the density fluctuations. Recall that the Fourier components of the density operator are\n\\[\n\\rho_\\mathbf{q}= \\sum_\\mathbf{k}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}.\n\\]\nOn the basis of the logic that we’ve been following so far, the most important terms will be those where one of \\(a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{q}}\\) or \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{k}\\) acts on the condensate. Thus\n\\[\n\\rho_\\mathbf{q}\\sim \\sqrt{N}\\left(a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{q}} + a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{q}}\\right) = \\sqrt{N}e^{-\\kappa_\\mathbf{q}} \\left(b^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{q}} + b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{q}}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\ne^{-\\kappa_\\mathbf{q}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})}{\\omega(\\mathbf{q})}}.\n\\]\nThe density fluctuations in the ground state are then\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_{-\\mathbf{q}}\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}} \\lvert 0 \\rangle = N\\frac{\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{q})}{\\omega(\\mathbf{q})}\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf{q}\\to 0} \\frac{N\\lvert{\\mathbf{q}}\\rvert}{2mc}.\n\\]\nOn the right hand side we have used the low momentum form of the Bogoliubov dispersion\n\\[\n\\omega(\\mathbf{q})\\xrightarrow{\\mathbf{q}\\to 0} c\\lvert{\\mathbf{q}}\\rvert\n\\]\nwhere \\(c = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_0U_0}{m}}\\) is the speed of sound. We see that the density fluctuations vanish as the wavevector goes to zero. This is to be contrasted with the result that we would find in the Gross–Pitaevskii ground state (or ground state of the ideal gas)\n\\[\n\\langle{0}\\rvert \\rho_{-\\mathbf{q}}\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}} \\lvert 0 \\rangle = N.\n\\]\ncorresponding to uncorrelated, Poissonian fluctuations of number inside any volume of the gas. If we were to take a snapshot of the particles at any instant in the interacting gas, we would see a picture similar to the image of the Laughlin state in Lecture 2.\nThe other qualitatively new feature of the Bogoliubov ground state is that the zero momentum state is depleted. We find the momentum distribution by first writing the number operator \\(N_\\mathbf{p}=a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}}\\) in terms of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles\n\\[\n    a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}}=(b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}\\cosh\\kappa_{\\mathbf{p}}-b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{p}}\\sinh\\kappa_{\\mathbf{p}})(b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}\\cosh\\kappa_{\\mathbf{p}}-b^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}}\\sinh\\kappa_{\\mathbf{p}}),\n\\]\nand then finding the average\n\\[\n\\langle N_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle=\\langle a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}}\\rangle = \\sinh^2\\kappa_{p}\\xrightarrow{ \\lvert{\\mathbf{p}}\\rvert\\ll \\xi^{-1}}\\frac{mc_s}{2\\lvert{\\mathbf{p}}\\rvert}.\n\\]\nThe radial density distribution \\(4\\pi p^2 N_\\mathbf{p}\\) is peaked around \\(\\xi^{-1}\\). Summing over \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) gives the fraction of atoms not in the condensate\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}\\neq 0} \\langle N_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle=\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\sqrt{n a^3},\n\\]\nwhere we used the Born approximation for the scattering length \\(a=\\frac{mU_0}{4\\pi}\\). Excluding the value \\(\\mathbf{p}=0\\) has no effect, because of the vanishing phase space at small momentum in three dimensions.\nUnder typical experimental conditions in experiments on ultracold atoms the depletion does not much exceed \\(0.01\\), which justifies the use of the GP approximation. Liquid He\\(^{4}\\), the first superfluid to be discovered, can be described as an interacting Bose condensate, but the depletion is much larger (the condensate fraction – the fraction of atoms in the condensate – is around 10%). The Bogoliubov approximation does not provide a quantiatively accurate description in this case.\nIn the previous lecture we met another situation where the depletion can be increased. Applying a lattice effectively reduces the kinetic energy relative to the interaction, and leads eventually to a quantum phase transition out of the superfluid state.",

    "text": "3 Appendix\n\n3.1 Regularizing the ground state energy\nTo find the ground state energy in the Bogoliubov theory we have to compute the sum\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}\\neq 0}\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\omega(\\mathbf{p})-\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m}-n_0U_0\\right].\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nAfter turning it into an integral in the usual way, we have\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2 m}\\left[\\overbrace{\\int_0^\\Lambda p^2 \\sqrt{p^2\\left(p^2+\\frac{2}{\\xi^2}\\right)}dp}^{\\equiv I(\\Lambda)} - \\int_0^\\Lambda \\left(p^4 + \\frac{p^2}{\\xi^2}\\right) dp \\right]\n\\]\nwhere we have introduced an upper cutoff \\(\\Lambda\\) to see what happens as it increases to infinity. The first integral comes from the \\(\\omega(\\mathbf{p})\\) in the summand. \\(\\xi\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2m n U_0}}\\) is the healing length as before. Introducing the substitution \\(u=p^2\\) gives\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI(\\Lambda) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\int^{\\Lambda^2}_0 u\\sqrt{u+\\frac{2}{\\xi^2}} du \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\left[\\frac{1}{5}\\left(u+\\frac{2}{\\xi^2}\\right)^{5/2}-\\frac{2}{3\\xi^2} \\left(u+\\frac{2}{\\xi^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\right]^{\\Lambda^2}_0\\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\Lambda^5}{5} + \\frac{\\Lambda^3}{3\\xi^2} -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2\\xi^4}+\\cdots.\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{11}\\] In the expansion we have retained only the terms with positive powers of \\(\\Lambda\\). By comparing with the definition of \\(I(\\Lambda)\\), we can see that these terms arise from the first three terms in the large \\(p\\) expansion of the integrand\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\np^2 \\sqrt{p^2\\left(p^2+\\frac{2}{\\xi^2}\\right)} = p^4 + \\frac{p^2}{\\xi^2} - \\frac{1}{2\\xi^2}.\n\\end{equation}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nIn the original sum Equation 10 the contributions of the first two terms in Equation 12 are cancelled by subtracting \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m}+n_0U_0\\right]\\). This still leaves us with a divergence \\(\\propto \\Lambda\\) arising from last term of Equation 12. On the other hand, the sum\n\\[\nE_\\text{reg}\\equiv\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}\\neq 0}\\frac{1}\n{2}\\left[\\omega(\\mathbf{p})-\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})-n_0U_0+ \\frac{(n_0U_0)^2}{2\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})}\\right]\n\\]\nis finite as \\(\\Lambda\\to \\infty\\), because all positive powers of \\(\\Lambda\\) cancelled. The value is then given by the lower limit of the expression in Equation 11.\n\\[\nE_\\text{reg} = \\frac{V}{m\\pi^2}\\frac{16}{15}(mnU_0)^{5/2}\n\\]\nOK, but so what? That isn’t what we wanted. But notice that the regularized energy can be used to write the total energy as\n\\[\nE_0=\\frac{1}{2}nU_0  N\\left[1-\\frac{1}{V}\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\frac{U_0}{2\\tilde\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})}\\right]+E_\\text{reg}.\n\\]\nIn this form, the term we have added and subtracted can be identified as the contribution to the ground state energy in second order perturbation theory. This is divergent at large momentum for a delta function interaction, but this divergence goes away when we consider a finite range potential (we won’t show this, but it’s not too hard). Assuming that this contribution is finite because the interaction potential has a small (relative to \\(\\xi\\)) but finite range, we can then write\n\\[\nE_0=\\frac{1}{2}nN\\frac{4\\pi}{m}\\left(a_0+a_1\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}n_0N\\frac{4\\pi}{m}a_0\\frac\n{128}{15\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\left(n a_0^3\\right)^{1/2},\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\na_0=(m/4\\pi)U_0,\\qquad a_1=-(m/4\\pi)\\frac{U_0^2}{V}\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\frac{1}{2\\tilde\\epsilon\n(\\mathbf{p})}.\n\\]\nare the first two terms in the Born approximation for the scattering length \\(a=a_0+a_1+\\cdots\\). This strongly suggests that these two terms can really be expressed only in erms of the true scattering length. Notice also that the second term has a weird \\(U_0^{5/2}\\) dependence on the interaction strength, which is presumably connected to perturbation theory breaking down at the third order (see Problem Set 2).",

    "text": "1 Models of Matter\nIt’s important to realise that in general simple models are neither tractable, nor display simple behaviour! To take an example: all students of physics are familiar with the Ising model of magnetism, which caricatures a lattice of magnetic ions and their complex interactions. The Ising model is defined in terms of an energy function\n\\[\nH = J\\sum_{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle} \\sigma_j \\sigma_k,\n\\label{spin_ising}\n\\]\nwhere the ‘spin’ variables \\(\\sigma_j\\) take the values \\(\\pm 1\\). The notation \\({\\langle j\\,k\\rangle}\\) indicates that the sum is over all nearest neighbour pairs on some (e.g. cubic) lattice. A negative coupling \\(J&lt;0\\) tends to promote alignment of the spins.\nThe calculation of the partition function of the Ising model, and hence of its thermodynamic behaviour, is simple in 1D, extremely hard in 2D, and – as far as we know – impossible in the most interesting case of three dimensions. As well as being intractable, it is also highly unrealistic. The complexity of the magnetic atom, consisting of tens of electrons, is reduced to a single variable describing the spin only, which is not even treated quantum mechanically. Why on earth should we care?\nThe point is that the Ising model is a minimal working example. It is designed with the minimal set of ingredients necessary to demonstrate the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. The puzzle it seeks to explain is: how do a large number of microscopic ‘magnets’ (the spins), undergoing thermal fluctuations that are constantly seeking to randomize their direction, decide to develop a macroscopic magnetization in a particular direction? Why does the magnetization appear abruptly at the the Curie temperature, rather than gradually? Obviously the spins cannot be independent. The fact that the Ising model has a magnetic transition shows us that a nearest neighbour coupling is enough.\nThat we can cook up such minimal models and analyze them, even if we can’t solve them exactly, gives us confidence that whether we are talking about Iron, Nickel, or Cobalt, the essence of the magnetic transition is the same. By understanding something about the Ising model, we can say we have understood something about magnetism in general.\nThis certainly doesn’t mean the end of story, of course. Firstly, one can try to move towards a more realistic description of ferromagnetism. What is the microscopic origin and size of the coupling? Why does Cobalt have a higher Curie temperature than Nickel? How does the magnetism interact with other properties of the metal? These are all valid questions beyond our minimal working example.\nSecondly, one can ask whether, with similar models, one can describe qualitatively different phenomena. If \\(J&gt;0\\) do the spins anti-align at some transition? What if we change the lattice? Make it disordered? Let \\(\\sigma_j\\) be a vector instead of a scalar? Make it truly quantum?\nThis course pursues this second line of investigation. We will look at the simplest models decribing interacting bosons, fermions, and spins, and try to describe the properties of the states of matter that they form. These states of matter – magnets, metals, superconductors – have real world counterparts, and by studying their toy versions we learn what makes them tick. This strategy of introducing and analyzing new models is one of the ways in which theorists try to learn what states of matter may exist, and under what conditions.",

    "text": "1 Tight Binding Models\nA typical many body Hamiltonian consists of kinetic energy and interaction terms. We haven’t yet had much to say about the situation where the particles additionally feel a potential that could arise from the crystal lattice, or impurity atoms, or both. In this lecture we will be concerned with systems in periodic potentials, so that the noninteracting part of the Hamiltonian is (taking the 1D case for simplicity)\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left[-\\frac{1}{2m}\\partial_i^2 +V(x_i)\\right] = \\int \\left[\\frac{1}{2m}\\partial_x\\psi^\\dagger\\partial_x\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}+ V(x)\\psi^\\dagger\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}\\right] dx,\n\\]\nwith \\(V(x+a)=V(x)\\). As you know, Bloch’s theorem tells us that the eigenstates are labelled by a continuous index \\(k\\) (crystal momentum) and discrete index \\(n\\) (band index) and have the form\n\\[\n\\psi_{k,n}(x) = e^{ikx} \\varphi_{k,n}(x),\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\varphi_{k,n}\\) is periodic. \\(k\\) lies in the Brillouin zone \\((-\\pi/a,\\pi/a]\\). The eigenvalues \\(E_n(k)\\) give the energy bands.\nWe are going to be concerned with the case where the lattice potential is very strong, so that the wavefunctions – at least in the lowest bands that we assume are those occupied – are highly localized. The wavefunctions become very small between the minima of the potential. We will see that in this limit we can introduce operators \\(a^\\dagger_j\\), \\(a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\) describing particles in these localized states, and that the coupling between neighbouring sites can be captured by the tight binding Hamiltonian\n\\[\nH_t = -t \\sum_{j} \\left[a^\\dagger_ja^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j+1}+a^\\dagger_{j+1}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_j\\right],\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhich will play the role of kinetic energy in our models. In fact, we’ve already met such a description, when we described a magnon propagating in a spin chain in Lecture 4.\n\n1.1 Physical Motivation\nThis subsection is to shed some light on the origin of Equation 2. Feel free to jump to the conclusion.\nLet’s think about the form of the Bloch states in a deep 1D lattice in more detail. You know that in a stationary state, the current \\(j(x)\\) is conserved\n\\[\nj = -\\frac{i}{2m}\\left[\\psi^*(\\partial_x\\psi^{}) - (\\partial_x\\psi^*)\\psi^{}\\right].\n\\tag{3}\\]\nRepresenting \\(\\psi(x)=\\sqrt{\\rho(x)}e^{i\\theta(x)}\\), this can be written\n\\[\nj = \\frac{\\rho\\partial_x\\theta}{m}.\n\\]\nThe Bloch states at non-zero \\(k\\) carry a current. As we’ve said, away from the minima of the lattice potential, the amplitude of the wavefunction is very small. Thus if \\(j\\) is constant, \\(\\partial_x\\theta\\) must be large. Essentially all of the change in the phase of the wavefunction happens in these regions. Where the wavefunction is larger, its phase is barely changing.\nTo describe this situation more quantitatively, we use the WKB approximation, which consists in writing the wavefunction in the form\n\\[\n\\psi_\\text{WKB}(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{k(x)}}\\exp\\left(i\\int^ x k(x')dx'\\right)+ \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{k(x)}}\\exp\\left(-i\\int^ x k(x')dx'\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(k(x) = \\sqrt{2m(E-V(x))}\\). In fact, we want to describe the part of the wavefunction with real exponents, where \\(k(x) = i\\kappa(x)\\) because \\(V(x)&gt;E\\). Substitution into the current Equation 3 gives\n\\[\nj = \\frac{1}{m}\\text{Im}\\, \\alpha^*\\beta^{}.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\n\nThe Bloch states in the WKB picture.\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the amplitude of the wavefunction in the well on the left, and \\(\\beta\\) is the amplitude on the right. By periodicity of the Bloch state, it is only their phase that differs. Call this phase change \\(\\theta\\). In terms of the Bloch states Equation 1 \\(\\theta=ka\\). Then Equation 4 says\n\\[\nj = \\frac{|\\alpha|^2}{m}\\sin\\theta.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nNow the Bloch function \\(\\varphi_k(x)\\) satisfies the Schrödinger equation (we drop the band index)\n\\[\n\\left[-\\frac{1}{2m}\\left(\\partial_x + ik\\right)^2 + V(x)\\right]\\varphi_k(x) = E_k \\varphi_k(x),\n\\]\nwhere a vector potential has arisen from the phase factor \\(e^{ikx}\\). By considering a small change \\(\\Delta k\\) as a perturbation we can find\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial E_k}{\\partial k} = ja,\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial E_k}{\\partial \\theta} = j.\n\\]\nTogether with Equation 5 we conclude that the band has the form\n\\[\nE(k)-E(0) = 2t\\left[1-\\cos ka\\right],\n\\]\nwith some characteristic energy \\(t\\). Thus we have found\n\nThe Bloch states look like a superposition of localized states, with the phase changing abruptly between sites.\nThe lowest band is sinusoidal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nConfirm that both these features are captured by the tight binding model Equation 2.",

In 1D, you can think of this as the lattice version of the Lieb–Liniger model, in that in involves a kinetic term (sometimes called the hopping term) and a short-ranged interaction.\nThe Hubbard model was first introduced to describe electrons in solids. In that case the particles are fermions, and we have to deal with their spin. We’ll come to this Fermi Hubbard model shortly. In this section we are going to discuss the more straightforward Bose Hubbard model introduced in {% cite Fisher:1989aa %}. These authors had in mind applications to liquid He\\(^{4}\\) on a substrate or granular superconductors in which the Cooper pairs (more on those later) approximate interacting bosons. However, ten years after its invention, the model found its natural home in the description of bosonic atoms confined to optical lattices.\n\n2.1 The Mott State\nIn analyzing a new model we always begin by asking what happens when each of the terms in the Hamiltonian dominate the others. This allows us to get the lie of the land, and think about how these different limits may fit together.\nFor the Bose–Hubbard model, we start by taking \\(U/t\\to\\infty\\) The eigenstates are then states of definite occupation number, with energy\n\\[\nE(\\mathbf{N}) = \\frac{U}{2} \\sum_j N_j(N_j-1).\n\\]\nTo find the ground state at fixed particle number, we should try filling the \\(N_\\text{sites}\\) sites as uniformly as possible. This is easy if the filling \\(\\nu \\equiv N_{\\text{particles}}/N_\\text{sites}\\) is integer. Otherwise, denote by \\(\\lfloor \\nu\\rfloor\\) the largest integer less than \\(\\nu\\), and \\(\\lceil \\nu\\rceil\\) the smallest integer larger than \\(\\nu\\). Then the number of sites with occupancy \\(\\lceil \\nu\\rceil\\) is \\(N_\\text{sites}\\left(\\nu - \\lfloor \\nu\\rfloor\\right)\\). The ground state energy has a piecewise linear dependence on \\(\\nu\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{E_0}{N_\\text{sites}} = \\left(\\nu - \\lfloor \\nu\\rfloor\\right)e(\\lceil \\nu\\rceil) + \\left(\\lceil \\nu\\rceil - \\nu\\right)e(\\lfloor \\nu\\rfloor),\n\\]\nwhere \\(e(N) = \\frac{U}{2}N(N-1)\\). As the result the chemical potential \\(\\mu = \\frac{\\partial E_0}{\\partial N_\\text{particles}}\\) is piecewise constant, with jumps occurring when \\(\\nu\\) is integer:\n\\[\n\\mu = e(\\lceil \\nu\\rceil) -e(\\lfloor \\nu\\rfloor)=U\\lfloor \\nu\\rfloor,\n\\]\n\n\n\nEnergy and chemical potential vs. filling \\(\\nu\\).\n\n\nIf we think about varying the chemical potential instead, all values between \\(UN\\) and \\(U(N-1)\\) correspond to integer filling \\(\\nu=N\\). The states of integer filling are named Mott states, after Nevill Mott. Mott’s realization was that when interactions dominate the hopping, the formation of such states can cause insulating behaviour, even when band theory implies a system should be a metal.\n\n\n2.2 The Effect of Hopping\nFor these states to be physically significant, they must survive when we turn \\(H_t\\) back on. If the hopping is small, we can think of it as a perturbation. The unperturbed eigenstates of the model have a fixed occupation \\(N_j\\) on site \\(j\\)\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}}\\rangle = \\bigotimes_j \\lvert{N_j}\\rangle_j.\n\\]\nApplying \\(H_t\\) to such a state gives a superposition of states, each with one particle moved from one site to an adjacent site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nHow is a Mott state (all sites with the same occupation) changed by \\(H_t\\) in first order perturbation theory?\n\n\nLet’s now consider a Mott state of filling \\(\\nu=N\\) with one extra particle added. We now have \\(N_\\text{sites}\\) degenerate ground states when \\(t=0\\), corresponding to placing the extra particle on each lattice site. \\(H_t\\) mixes these states together: we have a problem of degenerate perturbation theory. All other states are separated from these lowest states by energies of order \\(U\\).\nThe states in the ground state multiplet are\n\\[\n\\lvert{i,+}\\rangle\\equiv \\frac{a^\\dagger_i}{\\sqrt{N+1}}\\bigotimes_{j} \\lvert{N}\\rangle_j.\n\\]\nEvidently, only states corresponding to adjacent \\(j\\) are coupled by \\(H_t\\). These matrix elements are\n\\[\n\\langle{j}\\rvert H_t \\lvert k \\rangle = -t(N+1).\n\\]\nThus within the ground state multiplet \\(H_t\\) corresponds to a tight binding model\n\\[\nH_t\\rvert_{+} = -t(N+1) \\sum_{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle} \\left[\\lvert{j,+}\\rangle\\langle{k,+}\\rvert+\\text{h.c.}\\right].\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThis is a very simple picture: the only many body effect is the factor of \\(N\\) due to Bose statistics. The splitting of the degenerate states by \\(H_t\\) is then given by the tight binding dispersion\n\\[\n\\omega_+(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}) = -2t(N+1)\\sum_{n=1}^d\\cos\\eta_n\n\\tag{7}\\]\n(in \\(d\\)-dimensions). We could alternatively remove a particle from the Mott state\n\\[\n\\lvert{i,-}\\rangle\\equiv \\frac{a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_i}{\\sqrt{N}}\\bigotimes_{j} \\lvert{N}\\rangle_j.\n\\]\nWithin these states, \\(H_t\\) takes the form\n\\[\nH_t\\rvert_{-}=-tN \\sum_{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle} \\left[\\lvert{j,-}\\rangle\\langle{k,-}\\rvert+\\text{h.c.}\\right],\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwith a spectrum\n\\[\n\\omega_-(\\boldsymbol{\\eta}) = -2tN\\sum_{n=1}^d\\cos\\eta_n.\n\\]\nLet’s see how these considerations change the picture of the previous subsection. We introduce the grand canonical Hamiltonian\n\\[\n\\mathcal{H}_\\mu = H - \\mu N_\\text{particles},\n\\]\nand consider the ground state as a function of \\(\\mu\\). At \\(t=0\\) the energies of the Mott states with filling \\(\\nu=N\\) are\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathcal{E}^{(N)}_\\mu}{N_\\text{sites}} = \\frac{U}{2}N(N-1)-\\mu N.\n\\]\n\\(\\mathcal{E}^{(N)}_\\mu\\) and \\(\\mathcal{E}^{(N+1)}_\\mu\\) become degenerate when \\(\\mu=UN\\) for \\(t=0\\). Let’s compare this with the ground state with one extra particle on top of the \\(N\\) Mott state. This state corresponds to a particle at the bottom of the tight binding band. From Equation 7, we see that the ground state energy of the tight binding model is \\(-2td(N+1)\\). Together with extra energy of interaction we have overall\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}^{(N)}_\\mu + UN - \\mu -2dt(N+1).\n\\]\nWe see that for \\(t&gt;\\frac{UN-\\mu}{2d(N+1)}\\) the state with an extra particle actually has a lower energy: the Mott state is not the ground state. Similarly, the energy of the ground state with one ‘hole’ in the \\(N+1\\) Mott state is\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E}^{(N+1)}_\\mu - UN + \\mu -2dt(N+1).\n\\]\nIntroducing a hole is thus favoured for \\(t&gt;\\frac{\\mu-UN}{2d(N+1)}\\).\n\n\n\nComparing the energies of the Mott states with single particle or hole states. At \\(t=0\\) the red line is the absolute ground state. For nonzero \\(t\\) the dashed blue line corresponds to non-integer filling.\n\n\nThis analysis applies only at small \\(t/U\\). What happens in the regions where the Mott states are not the ground states, and there are excess bosonic particles or holes that are free to move? If we let \\(t/U\\to\\infty\\) we have a Bose condensate: all the particles can sit in the \\(\\eta=0\\) Bloch state. When interactions are finite but small, we will see in the next lecture that the result is a superfluid. The boundaries that we have have found can be connected (drawing freehand – see Problem Set 2 for a variational approach) to give the following phase diagram for the ground state of the Bose–Hubbard model.\n\n\n\nGround state phase diagram of the Bose–Hubbard model.\n\n\nNote the diminishing size of the Mott lobes, a consequence of the enhanced hopping in the effective tight binding models Equation 6 and Equation 8 as we go to higher filling.\n\n\n\nWith a trap potential as well as a lattice, moving radially outwards corresponds to moving down a vertical slice through the phase diagram, producing this distinctive ‘wedding cake’ structure. Successive Mott states are separated by superfluid regions. Source: Cheng Chin, University of Chicago.",

    "text": "3 Fermi Hubbard Model\nNow we turn to the case of fermions, the context in which the Hubbard model was originally introduced. Allowing for spin, the model is usually written.\n\\[\nH=-t \\sum_{\\substack{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle\\\\ s=\\uparrow,\\downarrow}}  \\left[a^\\dagger_{j,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{k,s}+a^\\dagger_{k,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j,s}\\right] + U\\sum_j N_\\uparrow N_\\downarrow,\n\\]\nWe could of course add spin to the Bose Hubbard model, but it’s still interesting without it. By contrast, we need spin here to have an interacting model. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this model in condensed matter physics because of the role that it has played in attempts to understand the high-temperature superconducting materials known as cuprates. The 2D model has long been argued to capture the physics of strong correlations in the CuO\\(_2\\) layers that form the backbone of these materials. ‘Capture the physics’ would ideally mean that the ground state of the model is superconducting. This is still a controversial issue: some believe that the Hubbard model suffices, if only we could learn enough about its behaviour; others that it is missing some ingredient – other bands, coupling between layers, phonons – that is vital to superconductivity.\nRelatively little is known for sure about the Hubbard model, except in 1D, where it can be solved exactly using the Bethe ansatz. You may be wondering why it’s so much harder than the Bose case. Let’s find out…\n\n3.1 Two Sites, Two Fermions\nAs in the Bose case, we start by thinking about \\(U/t\\to\\infty\\). In the limit we get Mott states: only three this time, corresponding to 0, 1, or 2 particles per site. Two particles on a site are described by \\(a^\\dagger_{j,s}a^\\dagger_{j,s'}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\), which is antisymmetric in the spin indices due to anticommutation of the creation operators, and therefore describes a spin singlet \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\lvert{\\uparrow}\\rangle\\lvert{\\downarrow}\\rangle-\\lvert{\\downarrow}\\rangle\\lvert{\\uparrow}\\rangle\\right]\\). When we have only 1 per site (We call this half filling), we can have either spin. Thus the \\(\\nu=1\\) Mott state is massively degenerate, with a ground state multiplet consisting of \\(2^{N_\\text{sites}}\\) possible spin configurations. \\(U/t\\to\\infty\\) is therefore a rather singular limit, and to understand the true ground state at large \\(U\\) we’ll need to work bit harder.\nStart by thinking about two sites and two particles. There are 6 states altogether in the Hilbert space.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\\quad a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\\\\na^\\dagger_{1,s}a^\\dagger_{2,s'} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\\quad s,s'=\\uparrow,\\downarrow.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe top two states have energy \\(U\\) when \\(t=0\\); the bottom 4 have energy 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nHow does the degeneracy of these states get lifted at finite \\(t\\)? Try writing down the Hamiltonian restricted to these states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note is that the Hamiltonian \\(H_t\\) has no effect on the states \\(a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\) and \\(a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\), because it is not possible to move two fermions with the same spin to the same site. Thus we need to consider only the four states\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lvert{1}\\rangle&=a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\\\\n\\lvert{2}\\rangle&=a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\\\\n\\lvert{3}\\rangle&=a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\\\\n\\lvert{4}\\rangle&=a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\(H_t\\) connects \\(\\lvert{1}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert{2}\\rangle\\) with \\(\\lvert{3}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert{4}\\rangle\\). We compute the matrix elements\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Braket{1|H_t|3} &= \\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\uparrow} H_t a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=-t\\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\uparrow} a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\downarrow} a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=t\\\\\n\\Braket{2|H_t|3} &= \\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\uparrow} H_t a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=-t\\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\uparrow} a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\uparrow} a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=-t\\\\\n\\Braket{1|H_t|4} &= \\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\uparrow} H_t a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=-t\\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\uparrow} a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\uparrow} a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=t\\\\\n\\Braket{2|H_t|4} &= \\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\uparrow} H_t a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=-t\\Braket{\\text{VAC}|a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{2,\\uparrow} a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{1,\\downarrow} a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow}|\\text{VAC}}\\\\\n&=t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis gives the Hamiltonian\n\\[\n\\Braket{j|H|k} = \\begin{pmatrix}\nU & 0 & t & -t \\\\\n0 & U & t & -t \\\\\nt & t & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-t & -t & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nNote that the off-diagonal block\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nt & -t \\\\\nt & -t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nonly connects the states \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{1}\\rangle+\\lvert{2}\\rangle\\right)\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{3}\\rangle-\\lvert{4}\\rangle\\right)\\), and we arrive at the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nU & 2t \\\\\n2t & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwith eigenvalues \\(U/2 \\pm \\sqrt{U^2/4+4t^2}\\). Expanding for small \\(t/U\\) gives \\(U + \\frac{4t^2}{U}\\) and \\(-4t^2/U\\).\nNote that the state \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{3}\\rangle+\\lvert{4}\\rangle\\right)\\) is a spin-triplet, which is why its energy is unaffected, like the states \\(a^\\dagger_{1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\uparrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\) and \\(a^\\dagger_{1,\\downarrow}a^\\dagger_{2,\\downarrow} \\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\) that we discarded initially. The effect of finite \\(t\\) is therefore to lower the energy of the singlet state by \\(4t^2/U\\) relative to the triplet state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Effective Hamiltonian\nAs the number of sites increases, it becomes harder to say what happens to the ground state multiplet. We now modify our strategy by splitting the problem in two: we are going to find an effective Hamiltonian that acts only on the half filled Mott states and describes their splitting when \\(t/U\\) is finite but small. Whether we can subsequently solve that Hamiltonian we leave until later.\nAs I’m sure you realized when you thought about two sites, this is a qualitatively different degenerate perturbation problem than the one we solved when we added a single particle or hole to the bosonic Mott states. The reason is that \\(H_t\\) has no matrix elements among the degenerate states: when acting on one of them it always takes us into a state with one site doubly occupied and the neighouring site empty. We have to think about second order degenerate perturbation theory to find out what happens. To handle this we divide the Hamiltonian into block form, according to whether its matrix elements act on the Mott state or not.\n\\[\nH = \\begin{pmatrix}\nH_{\\text{Mott}} & V^{} \\\\\nV^\\dagger & H_\\text{Not} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nDenoting by \\(P_\\text{Mott}\\) the projection operator on to the \\(2^{N_\\text{sites}}\\) Mott states, and \\(P_\\text{Not}\\equiv 1-P_\\text{Mott}\\), we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\text{Mott}= P_\\text{Mott} H P_\\text{Mott},\\quad H_\\text{Not}= P_\\text{Not}H P_\\text{Not}\\\\\nV^{} = P_\\text{Mott} H P_\\text{Not},\\qquad V^\\dagger = P_\\text{Not} H P_\\text{Mott}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn the case of the Hubbard model, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_\\text{Mott}= P_\\text{Mott} H_U P_\\text{Mott},\\quad H_\\text{Not}= P_\\text{Not}H P_\\text{Not}\\\\\nV^{} = P_\\text{Mott} H_t P_\\text{Not},\\qquad V^\\dagger = P_\\text{Not} H_t P_\\text{Mott}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that both \\(H_U\\) and \\(H_t\\) contribute to \\(H_\\text{Not}\\) because \\(H_t\\) can move particles and holes around in a non-Mott state. We write the eigenvalue equation in block form\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nH_{\\text{Mott}} & V^{} \\\\\nV^\\dagger & H_\\text{Not} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\\\\n\\lvert{\\Phi}\\rangle\n\\end{pmatrix} = E\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\\\\n\\lvert{\\Phi}\\rangle\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe eliminate \\(\\lvert{\\Phi}\\rangle\\) to obtain\n\\[\n\\left[H_{\\text{Mott}} -V^{}\\left(H_\\text{Not}-E\\right)^{-1}V^\\dagger\\right]\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle = E\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle.\n\\]\nSo far we have made no approximation. While this looks like an eigenvalue equation, we can’t yet interpret the operator in the square brackets as an effective Hamiltonian because it depends on the eigenvalue \\(E\\). However, we now focus on energies much smaller than the eigenvalues of \\(H_\\text{Not}\\), which are \\(O(U)\\). In this way we can neglect this energy dependence and arrive at the effective Hamiltonian acting only on the Mott state\n\\[\nH_\\text{eff} = H_{\\text{Mott}} -V^{} H^{-1}_\\text{Not}V^\\dagger.\n\\]\nWhat form does \\(H_\\text{eff}\\) take? \\(H_{\\text{Mott}}=0\\), and \\(V^\\dagger\\) creates states with an adjacent hole and doublon (doubly occupied site). \\(H_\\text{Not}\\) acting on these states is just \\(U\\), and \\(V\\) has to remove the hole and doublon. Thus,\n\\[\nH_\\text{eff} = -\\frac{V^{}V^\\dagger}{U} = -\\frac{t^2}{U} \\sum_{\\substack{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle\\\\s,s'}} \\left[a^\\dagger_{j,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{k,s} a^\\dagger_{k,s'}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j,s'}+j\\leftrightarrow k\\right].\n\\]\nWe can write this in a more familiar way by first reordering the operators (not forgetting the anticommutation relations!)\n\\[\na^\\dagger_{j,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{k,s} a^\\dagger_{k,s'}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j,s'} = -a^\\dagger_{j,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j,s'}a^\\dagger_{k,s'}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{k,s} + \\delta_{s^{}s'}a^\\dagger_{j,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j,s'},\\qquad j\\neq k\n\\]\nand then using the identity\n\\[\n\\delta_{ab}\\delta_{cd} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{a d}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{c b} + \\delta_{ad}\\delta_{cb}\\right].\n\\]\nFinally, in \\(d\\) dimensions (\\(d=1\\), chain; \\(d=2\\) square lattice; \\(d=3\\) cubic lattice) we get\n\\[\nH_\\text{eff} = -\\frac{dN_\\text{sites}t^2}{U}+J\\sum_{\\langle j\\,k\\rangle} \\mathbf{s}_j\\cdot \\mathbf{s}_k\n\\label{FilledHeff}\n\\]\nwith \\(J=\\frac{4t^2}{U}\\) and\n\\[\n\\mathbf{s}_j=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{s,s'}a^\\dagger_{j,s}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s^{}s'}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j,s'}.\n\\]\nThe effective Hamiltonian is nothing but the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nNote that there is something slightly sly about this derivation. We assumed that the energy scale \\(U\\) was the largest scale in the problem, in order to arrive at the effective Hamiltonian. However, typical excited state energies of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian are \\(\\frac{N_\\text{sites}t^2}{U}\\). Thus for \\(N_\\text{sites}\\gtrsim \\left(\\frac{t}{U}\\right)^2\\) there isn’t actually a separation between these two energies. Not a very useful condition! Physically, it’s enough to have a small density  \\(n\\) of doublons and holes, with overall energy \\(\\sim nU\\), when \\(t/U\\) is small.\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Doping\nAntiferromagnetism and the Mott phenomenon are seen to go hand in hand in fermion systems. This explains the common ocurrence of antiferromagnetism in transition metal compounds, especially oxides. The cuprate superconductors mentioned earlier are a famous example.\n\n\n\nSchematic temperature vs. doping diagram for the cuprate materials [Source].\n\n\nAt half filling, the cuprates are antiferromangetic Mott insulators. Superconductivity emerges when the materials are doped by changing their stoichiometry. This introduces electrons or holes into the CuO\\(_2\\) planes that are modeled by the Hubbard Hamiltonian. Antiferromagnetic order is believed to be destroyed by freely moving holes – think how the Néel ordering is disrupted – and indeed superconductivity appears where antiferromagnetism dies. The precise relationship between the two phenomena is – like much of the physics of the cuprates – not clear.\nAn effective Hamiltonian that describes the doped Mott insulator is the t-J model\n\\[\nH_\\text{eff} = -t \\sum_{\\substack{\\langle j,k\\rangle\\\\ s=\\uparrow,\\downarrow}}  \\left[a^\\dagger_{j,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{k,s}+a^\\dagger_{k,s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{j,s}\\right] + J\\sum_{\\langle j,k\\rangle}\\left[\\mathbf{s}_j\\cdot \\mathbf{s}_k - \\frac{N_j N_k}{4}\\right].\n\\tag{9}\\]\nThe model is defined by supplementing the Hamiltonian with the constraint that there are no doubly occupied sites. That is, we ignore such states in the Hilbert space. This could be achieved by applying the projector \\(\\prod_{j} (1-N_{j,\\uparrow}N_{j,\\downarrow})\\). The term involving \\(N_j N_k\\) keeps track of the need for both sites to be occupied in the derivation of the effective coupling (c.f. it’s just the “constant” term in Equation 9. The hopping term means that holes or doubly occupied sites can move through the lattice, with the Heisenberg exchange term only acting between sites with one particle, since the operators \\(\\mathbf{s}_j\\) vanish when they act on an empty or doubly occupied site.",

Perhaps we should therefore give a very quick summary of why it appears to be true.\nThe first question is: what are indistinguishable particles? I’ll give a theorist’s answer. Indistinguishable particles are those described by Hamiltonians that are invariant under permuting the particle’s labels. Thus the sum of single particle Hamiltonians\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m}+V(\\mathbf{r_i})\\right]\n\\]\n[did you remember that \\(\\hbar=1\\)?] describes indistinguishable particles while\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m_i}+V(\\mathbf{r_i})\\right]\n\\]\ndoes not, on account of the masses being all different. Any time we have a symmetry operation that commutes with the Hamiltonian, the eigenstates of that symmetry are preserved by time evolution with that Hamiltonian. Thus a symmetric potential \\(V(x)=V(-x)\\) commutes with the parity operation \\(x\\to -x\\), so the eigenstates of this operation – the even and odd wavefunctions – are preserved by time evolution.\nThe Hamiltonian of indistinguishable particles commutes with every operator of particle exchange, defined by \\[\nP_{ij}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_i,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_j,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_j,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_i,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N).\n\\]\nThese operators satisfy \\(P_{ij}^2=\\mathbb{1}\\), so their eigenvalues are \\(\\pm 1\\), corresponding to states that are either symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange. The only simultaneous eigenstates of all particle exchange operations (note that different exchanges don’t commute if they involve the same particle) are the totally symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions. Thus these properties are preserved by time evolution. It’s always been this way.\nWe classify particles into symmetric bosons and antisymmetric fermions, named for Bose and Fermi respectively (the whimsical terminology is Dirac’s). The distinction works equally well for composite particles, provide we ignore the internal degrees of freedom and discuss only the center of mass coordinate. \nAll matter in the universe is made up of fermions: electrons, quarks, etc., but you can easily convince yourself that an even number of fermions make a composite boson (e.g. a \\(^4\\)He atom with two electrons, two neutrons and two protons) and an odd number make a composite fermion (\\(^3\\)He has one fewer neutron, which in turn is made up of 3 quarks).\n\n1.1 Two Particles\nA pair of particles is described by a wavefunction \\(\\Psi(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\). If we are dealing with distinguishable particles, the wavefunction of a pair of particles in states \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_1}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_2}\\rangle\\) would be\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAccounting for indistinguishability, we have either\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)]\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwith the upper sign for bosons and the lower for fermions (The \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\) yields a normalized wavefunction if \\(\\varphi_{1,2}(\\mathbf{r})\\) are orthonormal.). Note in particular that when \\(\\varphi_1=\\varphi_2\\) the fermion wavefunction vanishes. This illustrates the Pauli exclusion principle, that no two identical fermions can be in the same quantum state. There is no such restriction for bosons.\nClassically, if you had a function \\(\\rho_{1}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\) describing the probability density of finding particle \\(1\\) at position \\(\\mathbf{r}_1\\), and the corresponding quantity for an independent particle \\(2\\), you would have no hesitation in concluding that the joint distribution is\n\\[\n\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\label{eq:classicaljoint}\n\\]\nThis also follows from taking the square modulus of Equation 1. The result implied by the wavefunction Equation 2 is \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)+\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\right] \\\\\n&\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\varphi^{}_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^*_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^{}_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^*_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)+\\varphi^{}_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^*_2(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\varphi^{}_2(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi^*_1(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn particular, \\(\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}) = 0\\) for fermions, and \\(\\rho_{12}(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}) = 2\\rho_1(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_2(\\mathbf{r})\\) for bosons. The first result is natural from the standpoint of the exclusion principle, while the second is perhaps more surprising. This shows that, because probabilities arise from the squares of amplitudes, identical particles in quantum mechanics are never truly independent.\nOne dramatic illustration of this deviation from our classical intuition is provided by the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect in quantum optics. In simplified terms, we imagine wavepackets describing two photons (bosons) approaching a 50:50 beam splitter from either side. Because of the unitarity of scattering, the two photons end up in orthogonal states. For example, \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle+ \\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\right)\\\\\\\\\n\\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\to\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\lvert{\\text{Left}}\\rangle- \\lvert{\\text{Right}}\\rangle\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nIf we start in \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_\\text{L}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\text{R}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\pm \\varphi_\\text{R}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\varphi_\\text{L}(\\mathbf{r}_2)]\n\\] What state do we end up in?\n\n\n\n\n\nFour possible outcomes after the passage of two bosons through a beam splitter.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Product States\nThe Hamiltonian of a system of \\(N\\) identical noninteracting particles is a sum of \\(N\\) identical single particle Hamiltonians, that is, with each term acting on a different particle coordinate\n\\[\nH = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[-\\frac{\\nabla_i^{2}}{2m}+V(\\mathbf{r}_i)\\right]\n\\label{quantum_statistics_SPHamiltonian}\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is the particle mass, and \\(V(\\mathbf{r})\\) is a potential experienced by the particles.\nLet’s denote the eigenstates of the single particle Hamiltonian by \\(\\{\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r})\\}\\) , and the corresponding eigenenergies by \\(\\{E_\\alpha\\}\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a shorthand for whatever quantum numbers are used to label the states.\nA set of labels \\(\\{\\alpha_{i}\\}\\) \\(i=1,2,\\ldots N\\) tells us the state of each of the particles. Thus we can write an eigenstatof \\(N\\) distinguishable particles with energy \\(E=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{\\alpha_{i}}\\) as\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\Psi_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots \\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle=\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}})\n\\tag{3}\\]\n(We will frequently switch between the wavefunction \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{x})\\) and bra-ket notation \\(\\lvert{\\varphi}\\rangle\\). In the latter notation the product wavefunction in Equation 1 is written \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{1}}\\rangle\\lvert{\\varphi_{2}}\\rangle\\))\nSuch states are called product states. A general state will be expressed as a superposition of product states: they are special states which provide a frequently convenient basis.\nAs we’ve just discussed, however, we should really be dealing with a totally symmetric or totally antisymmetric wavefunction, depending on whether our identical particles are bosons or fermions. To write these down we introduce the operators of symmetrization and antisymmetrization\n\\[\n\\mathcal{S}=\\frac{1}{N!}\\sum_{\\pi} P_\\pi, \\qquad \\mathcal{A}=\\frac{1}{N!}\\sum_{\\pi} \\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)P_\\pi\n\\tag{4}\\]\nHere’s the definition of the various quantities in Equation 4:\n\nThe sums are over all \\(N!\\) permutations \\(\\pi\\) of \\(N\\) objects. One way to think of a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is as a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) between the set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots N\\}\\) and itself, so that 1 is mapped to \\(\\pi(1)\\), etc..\n\\(P_\\pi\\) denotes the corresponding permutation operator \\[\nP_\\pi \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_N) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(1)}, \\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(2)},\\ldots \\mathbf{r}_{\\pi(N)})\n\\]\n\\(\\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)\\) is the signature of the permutation, equal to \\(+1\\) for permutations involving an even number of exchanges (transpositions), and \\(-1\\) for an odd number. Note that although the same permutation can be accomplished with many different sets of transpositions, the number of transpositions is either always odd or always even.\n\nEquation 4 allows us to write the totally symmetric and totally antisymmetric versions of Equation 3 as \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lvert{\\Psi^{S}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle&=\\sqrt{\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\mathcal{S}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}}) \\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N!\\prod_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha}!}}\\sum_\\pi\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(1)}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(2)}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(N)}})\\\\\n\\lvert{\\Psi^{A}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle&=\\sqrt{N!}\\mathcal{A}\\,\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}})\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N!}}\\sum_\\pi \\mathrm{sgn}(\\pi)\\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(1)}})\\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(2)}})\\cdots\\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{\\pi(N)}}),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nwhere the occupation numbers \\(\\{N_{\\alpha}\\}\\) in the boson case give the number of particles in state \\(\\alpha\\). These normalization factors yield normalized wavefunctions if the single particle state \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\) are orthonormal (as the eigenstates of the single particle Hamiltonian are). In the fermion case each \\(N_{\\alpha}\\) is either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) so the prefactor simplifies. Since the order of the \\(\\alpha\\) indices is irrelevant in the boson case, and amounts only to a sign in the fermion case, states based on a given set of single particle states are more efficiently labeled by the occupation numbers. In terms of these numbers the total energy is\n\\[\n\\label{quantum_statistics_TotalEnergy}\nE=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{\\alpha_{i}}=\\sum_{\\alpha}N_{\\alpha} E_{\\alpha}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nVerify that the normalization factors in Equation 5 are correct.\n\n\nA more formal way of putting things is as follows. We first consider the space spanned by states of the form Equation 3. Then we introduce the operators \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), noting that \\(\\mathcal{S}^{2}=\\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}^{2}=\\mathcal{A}\\). In other words, there’s no point symmetrizing or antisymmetrizing more than once (we say that the operators are idempotent). Any eigenvalue of one of these operators is therefore either one or zero. The states with \\(\\mathcal{S}=1\\) are the symmetric states, and those with \\(\\mathcal{A}=1\\) are antisymmetric. You can easily convince yourself that if a state has one of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) or \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) equal to one, the other is zero. This defines symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, consisting of the admissible boson and fermion wavefunctions.\nNote that the fermion wavefunction takes the form of a Slater determinant (though it appears first in {% cite dirac1926 %}).\n\\[\n   \\lvert{\\Psi^{A}_{\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{2}\\cdots\\alpha_{N}}}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{2}}) & \\cdots & \\varphi_{\\alpha_{1}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}}) \\\\\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{2}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n   \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n   \\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{1}}) &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\varphi_{\\alpha_{N}}(\\mathbf{r_{N}})\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe vanishing of a determinant when two rows or two columns are identical means that the wavefunction is zero if two particle coordinates coincide (\\(\\mathbf{r}_{i}=\\mathbf{r}_{j}\\)), or if two particles occupy the same state (\\(\\alpha_{i}=\\alpha_{j}\\)).",

    "text": "2 The 1D Fermi Gas\nLet’s consider perhaps the simplest many particle system one can think of: noninteracting particles on a ring. If the ring has circumference \\(L\\), the single particle eigenstates are \\[\n    \\label{quantum_statistics_spstates}\n    \\varphi_{n}(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}}\\exp\\left(ik_n x\\right),\n\\]\nwith \\(k_n=\\frac{2\\pi n}{L}\\), \\(n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\). The corresponding energies are \\(E_{n}=\\frac{k_n^2}{2m}\\).\n\n2.1 Ground State\nLet’s find the \\(N\\) particle ground state. For bosons every particle is in the state \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_{0}}\\rangle\\) with zero energy: \\(N_{0}=N\\). Thus\n\\[\n    \\Psi^{S}_0(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots x_{N})=\\frac{1}{L^{N/2}}\n\\]\nThat was easy! The fermion case is harder.\nSince the occupation of each level is at most one, the lowest energy is obtained by filling each level with one particle, starting at the bottom. If we have an odd number of particles, this means filling the levels with \\(n=-(N-1)/2, -(N-3)/2,\\ldots, -1, 0, 1 \\ldots (N-1)/2\\) (for an even number of particles we have to decide whether to put the last particle at \\(n=\\pm N/2\\)). Introducing the complex variables\n\\[\nz_{i}=\\exp(2 \\pi i x_{i}/L),\n\\]\nthe Slater determinant Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n    \\Psi^A_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)=\\begin{vmatrix}\n    z_{1}^{-(N-1)/2} &  z_{2}^{-(N-1)/2} & \\cdots & z_{N}^{-(N-1)/2} \\\\\n    z_{1}^{-(N-3)/2} &  \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n    \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\n    z_{1}^{(N-1)/2} &  \\cdots & \\cdots & z_{N}^{(N-1)/2}\n\\end{vmatrix}.\n\\tag{7}\\]\nLet’s evaluate this complicated looking expression in a simple case. With three particles we have\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Psi^A_0(x_1,x_2,x_3)&=\\begin{vmatrix}\n        z_{1}^{-1} & z_{2}^{-1} & z_{3}^{-1} \\\\\n        1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n        z_{1} & z_{2} & z_{3}\n    \\end{vmatrix} = \\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}-\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{1}}+\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{1}}-\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{3}}+\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{3}}-\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{2}}\\nonumber\\\\\n    &=\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{1}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{3}}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{1}}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{2}}{z_{3}}}-\\sqrt{\\frac{z_{3}}{z_{2}}}\\right)  \\nonumber\\\\\n    &\\propto \\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{1}-x_{2}]}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{3}-x_{1}]}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{ \\pi[x_{2}-x_{3}]}{L}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nThe vanishing of the wavefunction when \\(x_{i}=x_{j}\\) is consistent with the Pauli principle. You should check that additionally it is periodic and totally antisymmetric.\nEquation 8 generalizes for any (odd) \\(N\\) so that the ground state Slater determinant Equation 7 is proportional to\n\\[\n\\Psi^A_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)\\propto\\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi[x_{i}-x_{j}]}{L}\\right).\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow this using the Vandermonde determinant \\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\\nz_{1} &  z_{2} & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\nz_{1}^{2} & z_{2}^{2} & \\cdots & \\cdots  \\\\\nz_{1}^{N-1} &  z_{2}^{N-1} & \\cdots & z_{N}^{N-1}\n\\end{vmatrix}=\\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N}(z_{j}-z_{i})\n\\] which can be proved in a variety of ways. Proving directly that Equation 9 is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not easy, but can be accomplished using the identity\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{2nd_quant_cotident}\n\\cot(x-y)\\cot(y-z)+\\cot(y-z)\\cot(z-x)+\\cot(z-x)\\cot(x-y)=1. \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nCheck carefully that Equation 9 is periodic and totally antisymmetric.\n\n\nLet’s take the opportunity to introduce some terminology. The wavevector of the last fermion added is called the Fermi wavevector and denoted \\(k_\\text{F}\\). In this case \\(k_\\text{F}=\\frac{(N-1)\\pi}{L}\\). Its energy \\(E_{F}=\\frac{k_\\text{F}^{2}}{2m}\\) is the Fermi energy.\n\n\n2.2 Density; Density Matrix; Pair Distribution\nHaving a many particle wave function is one thing, but what to do with it? Bear in mind that Equation 9 is just about the simplest fermion state you can imagine, but it’s not immediately clear what it is telling us.\n\\(\\vert\\Psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2\\) is the probability distribution of the positions of the particles. If we were able to take a photograph of the positions of the particles at an instant in time, this would correspond to taking a sample from the probability distribution. In terms of the complex variables \\(z_j\\), it would look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A sample from the probability distribution \\(\\lvert\\Psi^A_0(z_1,\\ldots,z_N)\\rvert^2\\) for 50 particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Uniformly distributed points on the circle described by \\(\\vert\\Psi^{S}_0(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots x_{N})\\rvert^2\\). The particle positions are uncorrelated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of particle positions for noninteracting fermion and boson ground states.\n\n\n\nSince \\(\\lvert\\Psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2\\) is the probability distribution of the positions of the particles, we can use it to find the marginal probability distributions for any subset of the particles. Of course, since the particles are identical, it doesn’t matter which ones we choose, just the number.\nThe one particle distribution is related to the average density of particles, given by \\[\n\\rho_1(x_1) = N \\int dx_2\\ldots dx_N \\,\\lvert\\Psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\rvert^2.\n\\tag{10}\\] Note that although I use the symbol \\(\\rho\\), density is always going to be number density (not the mass density).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nCan you explain why this is the density? Think about the simpler case of two particles, with discrete locations. Why is the expected number of particles at position \\(x\\) \\[\nN_x = \\sum_y \\left[P(x,y) + P(y,x)\\right]?\n\\]\nWhat if we have more particles?\n\n\nNormalization of the wavefunction then implies \\[\n\\int dx\\, \\rho_1(x) = N.\n\\] In a translationally invariant system like the fermion gas on a ring we expect the average density to be constant.\nWe can regard Equation 10 as an expectation of a density operator \\[\n\\rho(x) = \\sum_j \\delta(x-x_j),\n\\tag{11}\\] so that \\(\\rho_1(x) = \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert \\rho(x) \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle\\).\nThe single particle density matrix is a generalization of the expectation of the density, and is defined as (we’ll see shortly why this is a useful quantity) \\[\ng(x,y) \\equiv N\\int dx_2\\ldots dx_N \\,\\Psi^{}(x,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\Psi^{*}(y,x_2,\\ldots,x_N).\n\\tag{12}\\] Note that \\(g(x,x) = \\rho_1(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the average number of particles in a single particle state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\) is \\[\n\\bar N_\\psi = \\int dx dy\\, \\psi^*(x)g(x,y)\\psi(y).\n\\tag{13}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nStarting from the Slater determinant Equation 7 (i.e. not from the explicit form Equation 9), show that \\(g(x,y)\\) for the ground state of the Fermi gas is \\[\ng(x,y) = \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{|k|&lt;k_\\text{F}} e^{ik(x-y)} = \\int_{k_\\text{F}}^{k_\\text{F}} \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} e^{ik(x-y)} = n \\frac{\\sin \\left[k_\\text{F}(x-y)\\right]}{k_\\text{F}(x-y)}\n\\] where \\(n \\equiv \\frac{k_\\text{F}}{\\pi}\\) is the average density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nFind the average number of particles in a momentum state \\(\\lvert{k}\\rangle\\) using Equation 13 \\[\n\\bar N_k = \\begin{cases}\n1 & |k|\\leq k_\\text{F} \\\\\n0 & |k|&gt;k_\\text{F}\n\\end{cases}.\n\\tag{14}\\] Note that in a translationally invariant system \\(g(x,y)=g(x-y)\\), and is the Fourier transform of \\(\\bar N_k\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo understand the origin of the name single particle density matrix, recall that the density matrix \\(\\varrho\\) describes a mixed state of a quantum system, and is the appropriate description when the quantum state is not known. \\(\\varrho\\) is a positive definite hermitian operator satisfying \\(\\tr \\varrho =1\\). Its spectral resolution \\[\n\\varrho = \\sum_\\alpha p_\\alpha \\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\langle{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rvert,\n\\] can be thought of as a statistical mixture of different quantum states \\(\\lvert{\\varphi_\\alpha}\\rangle\\) with probabilities \\(p_\\alpha\\).\nOne natural way in which density matrices arise from pure states is as follows. The Hilbert space of a composite system consists of a tensor product of two or more components \\(\\mathcal{H}_{AB} = \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B\\). Starting from the density matrix corresponding to a pure state, we can obtain a density matrix for the component \\(A\\) alone by ‘tracing out’ the \\(B\\) subsystem. \\[\n\\varrho_A = \\tr_B \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert,\\quad \\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H}_{AB}.\n\\] The probability for system \\(A\\) to be in state \\(\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H}_A\\) is \\[\nP_\\psi = \\langle{\\psi}\\rvert\\varrho\\lvert{\\psi}\\rangle.\n\\] Thus you can think of the single particle density matrix Equation 12 as arising from tracing out \\(N-1\\) particles from an \\(N\\)-particle system.\nWe can also consider marginal probability distribution of a pair of particles, and define the pair distribution function \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = N(N-1) \\int dx_3\\ldots dx_N \\,\\left|\\Psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N)\\right|^2.\n\\] The prefactor is to account for all pairs of particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nStarting from the Slater determinant Equation 7, show that \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = n^2\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sin\\left[k_\\text{F}(x_1-x_2)\\right]}{k_\\text{F}(x_1-x_2)}\\right)^2\\right].\n\\] This vanishes at \\(x_1=x_2\\), consistent with the Pauli principle.\n\n\nA natural question: \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) \\overset{?}{=} \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x_1)\\rho(x_2)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle.\n\\] Almost. Looking back at Equation 11, we see that the product of two density operators will contain terms involving the same particle, which are absent from \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow that the correct relationship is \\[\n\\rho_2(x_1,x_2) = \\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert\\rho(x_1)\\rho(x_2)\\lvert{\\Psi}\\rangle - \\rho_1(x_1)\\delta(x_1-x_2).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Impenetrable Bose Gas\nThere’s a bit more mileage in the 1D Fermi gas yet. Consider the following Hamiltonian \\[\nH = -\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_j \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_j^2} + \\overbrace{c\\sum_{j&lt;k}\\delta(x_j-x_k)}^{\\equiv H_\\text{int}}.\n\\label{many_LL}\n\\] The second term represents an interaction between pairs of particles. Of course, this model is rather special, as (1) it’s 1D and (2) the interaction potential is a \\(\\delta\\)-function. Nevertheless, it represents a huge step up in difficulty from the noninteracting examples we’ve discussed so far. At least, it does for bosons. For fermions, the wavefunctions vanish at coincident points, and so the interaction has no effect at all!\nFor bosons, it happens that the Hamiltonian can still be solved exactly. For now, however, we’ll concern ourselves only with the limit of infinite interaction: \\(c\\to \\infty\\), sometimes called the impenetrable limit. In this case, the eigenenergies coincide with those of the free fermion problem, and the eigenstates are just the modulus of the corresponding fermion eigenstate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nJust like that, we’ve solved our first interacting many body system (and with infinite coupling, no less)!\nThus the ground state on the ring has the form \\[\n\\Psi_0(x_1,\\ldots, x_N) = \\prod_{i&lt;j}^{N} \\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi[x_{i}-x_{j}]}{L}\\right)\\right|.\n\\]\nIt’s not hard to see why this works. For a state to have a finite energy, the wavefunction must vanish whenever two coordinates coincide. This is because the interation energy has the expectation value \\[\n\\langle{\\Psi}\\rvert H_\\text{int} \\lvert \\Psi \\rangle=cN(N-1)\\int dx_1\\cdots dx_{N-1}\\left|\n\\Psi(x_1,x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_N\\right|^2\n\\] But we already have a complete set of eigenstates that obey this condition, namely the free fermion Slater determinants. It remains to make them symmetric functions by taking the modulus.\nThis mapping is quite powerful, and allows us to calculate any observable of the impenetrable Bose gas in terms of free fermions as long as that observable is insensitive to taking the modulus of the wavefunction. Thus the average density \\(\\rho_1(x)\\) and pair distribution \\(\\rho_2(x_1,x_2)\\) of the previous section can be found in this way, but the single particle density matrix \\(g(x,y)\\) cannot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nShow this explicitly.\n\n\nThis means that the momentum distribution is not given by Equation 14. Finding \\(g(x,y)\\) for the impenetrable Bose gas is in fact really hard. We’ll see in a later lecture how to obtain some of its important features.",

For the second order correction we need the matrix element \\(\\langle{\\mathbf{N}'}\\rvert H_\\text{int} \\lvert \\mathbf{N} \\rangle\\), which is nonzero if\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nN'_{\\mathbf{k}_1,\\uparrow} = N_{\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k}_1) + 1, \\quad N'_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_2) = N_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_2) + 1\\\\\nN'_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_3) = N_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_3) - 1, \\quad N'_{\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k}_4) = N_{\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k}_4) - 1,\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nfor \\(\\mathbf{k}_i\\) satisfying \\(\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}_4\\).

Fortunately, we are more interested in how the excitation energies are affected by interactions. This means we focus on the change in the occupation relative to the ground state, denoted by \\(n_s(\\mathbf{k})\\) and defined through\n\\[\nN_{s}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\theta(k_F-\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert) + n_{s}(\\mathbf{k})\n\\]\nThis might seem a bit odd given that \\(N_{s}(\\mathbf{k})=\\pm 1\\). You should think of this expansion in terms of the continuum limit, where the \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) values become finely spaced. In this limit \\(n_\\mathbf{k}\\) represents the mean deviation from the Fermi sphere in that region of \\(\\mathbf{k}\\)-space.\n\n\n\n\\(n_\\mathbf{k}\\) as a smoothed deviation from the Fermi step.\n\n\nThe excitation energy above the ground state of an eigenstate labelled by occupancies \\(N_\\mathbf{k}\\) can then be expanded in \\(n_\\mathbf{k}\\)\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k},s} \\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k})n_{s}(\\mathbf{k}) + \\frac{1}{2V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, s,\\mathbf{k}', s'} f_{s^{}s'}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')n_{s}(\\mathbf{k})n_{s'}(\\mathbf{k}').\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThis expansion is the key idea in the theory of the Fermi liquid. Although we will calculate the quasiparticle energy \\(\\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k})\\) and interaction function \\(f_{s^{}s'}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')\\) using perturbation theory, Landau’s idea was that any interacting Fermi system could be described in similar terms, as long as the ground state does not change abruptly as we increase the interaction from zero (normally a thought experiment!). An example of an abrupt change would be a transition from liquid to solid (crystallization).\nTo first order in the interaction we have the not-so-interesting result\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k}) &= \\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) + \\frac{U_0 N_{\\bar s}}{V}+\\cdots\\\\\nf_{\\uparrow\\downarrow} &= f_{\\downarrow\\uparrow} = U_0+\\cdots,\\quad f_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}=f_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}=0+\\cdots,\n\\label{fermi_first}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere the meaning of the \\(\\bar s\\) is \\(\\bar\\uparrow=\\downarrow\\), \\(\\bar\\downarrow=\\uparrow\\). The second order contributions to the \\(f\\)-function are more interesting, however. For example\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') = -\\frac{U_0^2}{V}\\left[\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_2} \\frac{N_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_3)(1-N_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_2))}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})+\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}')-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\\n\\left.+\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_2}\\frac{N_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_3)(1-N_{\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}_2))}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}')+\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWe will be interested in the low temperature limit, in which \\(n_{s}(\\mathbf{k})\\) is non-zero only in a very narrow region of size \\(k_\\text{B} T\\) around the Fermi surface. In this limit we can take the \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert=\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}'}\\rvert=k_\\text{F}\\), so that\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') = -\\frac{U_0^2}{V}\\left[\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_2} \\frac{N(\\mathbf{k}_3)(1-N(\\mathbf{k}_2))}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)}\n+\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_2}\\frac{N(\\mathbf{k}_3)(1-N(\\mathbf{k}_2))}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn which we have assumed the state around which we expand is unpolarized, i.e. \\(N_{s}(\\mathbf{k})\\) is independent of \\(s\\).\nThe expression for \\(f_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')\\) is more complicated\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') = U_0 + f_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') +\\frac{U_0^2}{V}\\left[\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}'=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}_4}\\frac{N(\\mathbf{k}_3)N(\\mathbf{k}_4)}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)+\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_4)-2E_\\text{F}}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\\n\\left.\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}'=\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2}\\frac{(1-N(\\mathbf{k}_1))(1-N(\\mathbf{k}_2))}{2E_\\text{F}-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_1)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEvaluating these expressions is simpler than calculating Equation 2, as we have only one independent momentum. The new feature that comes at second order is a nontrivial dependence of \\(f_{s^{}s'}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')\\) on the angle between \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}'\\).\nIt’s a bit fiddly to get at, but let’s work it out for the simpler case of \\(f_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')\\)!. The continuum limit is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') = \\frac{U_0^2}{(2\\pi)^3}\\left[\\int_{\\substack{\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_3}\\rvert&lt;k_\\text{F},\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_2}\\rvert&gt;k_\\text{F}\\\\ \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_2 }} \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}_3}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\\n\\left.+\\int_{\\substack{\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_3}\\rvert&lt;k_\\text{F},\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_2}\\rvert&gt;k_\\text{F}\\\\ \\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_2 }}\\frac{d\\mathbf{k}_3}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nSo we need to find the integral\n\\[\n\\int_{\\substack{\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_3}\\rvert&lt;k_\\text{F},\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_2}\\rvert&gt;k_\\text{F}\\\\ \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_2 }} \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}_3}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)}.\n\\]\nNote that the denominator can be written\n\\[\n\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)= \\frac{1}{2m}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_2+\\mathbf{k}_3\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{k}_2-\\mathbf{k}_3\\right) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_2+\\mathbf{k}_3\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}'\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}'\\) is fixed. Writing\n\\[\n\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_2+\\mathbf{k}_3\\right),\\quad \\mathbf{q}= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_2-\\mathbf{k}_3\\right),\n\\]\n\n\n\nGeometry of the integral for \\(f_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')\\).\n\n\nthe denominator becomes\n\\[\n\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3) = \\frac{2}{m}\\mathbf{K}\\cdot\\mathbf{q},\n\\]\nfor fixed \\(\\mathbf{q}\\). Thus, only the angle \\(\\theta\\) between \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{q}\\) enters the integral. The conditions \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_2}\\rvert&gt;k_\\text{F}\\) and \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_3}\\rvert&lt;k_\\text{F}\\) become\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\mathbf{K}+\\mathbf{q}\\right)^2&gt;k_\\text{F}^2,\\quad \\left(\\mathbf{K}-\\mathbf{q}\\right)^2&lt;k_\\text{F}^2,\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhich gives the range of \\(K_-(\\theta)&lt;\\lvert{\\mathbf{K}}\\rvert&lt;K_+(\\theta)\\)\n\\[\nK_{\\pm}(\\theta)=\\pm q\\lvert{\\cos\\theta}\\rvert+\\sqrt{k_\\text{F}^2-q^2\\sin^2\\theta},\n\\]\nand we must have \\(\\theta&lt;\\pi/2\\). In terms of these variables the integral becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{\\substack{\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_3}\\rvert&lt;k_\\text{F},\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_2}\\rvert&gt;k_\\text{F}\\\\ \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{k}_3=\\mathbf{k}'+\\mathbf{k}_2 }} \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}_3}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)}&=\n\\pi m\\int_0^{\\pi/2} d\\theta \\int_{K_-(\\theta)}^{K_+(\\theta)} \\frac{K\\sin\\theta}{q\\cos\\theta} dK\\nonumber\\\\\n&=2\\pi m\\int_0^{\\pi/2} d\\theta \\sin\\theta \\sqrt{k_\\text{F}^2-q^2\\sin^2\\theta}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe other integral in Equation 4 is the same but in the interval \\((\\pi/2,\\pi)\\). Thus we have Finally\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') &= \\frac{U_0^2 m}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int_0^{\\pi} d\\theta \\sin\\theta \\sqrt{k_\\text{F}^2-q^2\\sin^2\\theta}\\nonumber\\\\\n&=\\frac{U_0^2 m k_\\text{F}}{(2\\pi)^2}\\left[1 - \\frac{\\cos^2\\phi/2}{2\\sin\\phi/2}\\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\sin\\phi/2}{1+\\sin\\phi/2}\\right)\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nHere \\(\\phi\\) is the angle between \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}'\\) i.e. \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}'}\\rvert=2q=2k_\\text{F}\\sin\\phi/2\\). We won’t go through the calculation of \\(f_{+-}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')\\), but just record the final answer.\nThe definition Equation 3 implied a certain quantization axis for spin. To write things in an invariant way, we should think of the occupation number \\(N(\\mathbf{k})\\) as a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix that can describe an arbitrary spin orientation, with elements\n\\[\n\\mathsf{N}(\\mathbf{k})=\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k}) & N_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}) \\\\\nN_{\\downarrow\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{k}) & N_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}(\\mathbf{k}).\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe \\(f\\)-function then has four spin indices\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, s_1,s_2,\\mathbf{k}', s_3,s_4} f_{s_1s_2,s_3s_4}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')n_{s_1s_2}(\\mathbf{k})n_{s_3s_4}(\\mathbf{k}'),\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf_{s_1s_2,s_3s_4}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') = \\frac{U_0}{2}\\left[\\left(1+ \\frac{mU_0 k_\\text{F}}{2\\pi^2}\\left[2+\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{2\\sin\\phi/2}\\log\\frac{1+\\sin\\phi/2}{1-\\sin\\phi/2}\\right]\\right)\\delta_{s_1s_3}\\delta_{s_2s_4}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\\n\\left.\\left(1+ \\frac{mU_0 k_\\text{F}}{2\\pi^2}\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\phi/2\\log\\frac{1+\\sin\\phi/2}{1-\\sin\\phi/2}\\right]\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s_1s_3}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s_2s_4}\\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe message to take away from this calculation is not the detailed functional form of Equation 5, but the fact that the interaction between quasiparticles in an interacting Fermi gas is defined in terms of a pair of functions\n\\[\n\\nu(E_F)f_{s_1s_2,s_3s_4}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}') = F(\\phi) \\delta_{s_1s_3}\\delta_{s_2s_4} + G(\\phi)\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s_1s_3}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{s_2s_4}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe functions \\(F(\\phi)\\) and \\(G(\\phi)\\) have been made dimensionless by scaling by the density of states at the Fermi surface \\(\\nu(E_F)\\equiv k_{\\text{F}}m/\\pi^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Quasiparticle energy \\(\\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k})\\)\nSo far we haven’t had much to say about the quasiparticle energy \\(\\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k})\\) introduced in Equation 3. Evaluating the second order correction is going to be difficult, as it will involve two momentum integrations instead of one. What can we say on general grounds? We expect that\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k}) - E_\\text{F} = v_\\text{F}(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert-k_\\text{F}).\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe Fermi velocity \\(v_\\text{F}\\) defined by this expression may be altered by the interactions, allowing us to define an effective mass\n\\[\nm_* = \\frac{k_\\text{F}}{v_\\text{F}}.\n\\tag{8}\\]\nFortunately, we can get at this quantity using the results we already have, thanks to the following sneaky trick (due to Landau). If we increment the momentum of each quasiparticle by a small amount \\(\\delta\\mathbf{k}\\), we can compute the new energy using our energy functional Equation 3, along with a new distribution function\n\n\n\nShifting the Fermi sea to increase the momentum.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nN_s(\\mathbf{k}-\\delta\\mathbf{k}) &=\\theta(k_F-\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}-\\delta\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert) + n_{s}(\\mathbf{k}-\\delta\\mathbf{k})+\\cdots\\nonumber\\\\\n&=\\theta(k_F-\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert) + n_s(\\mathbf{k}) + \\delta(k_F-\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert)\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{k}- \\delta\\mathbf{k}\\nabla_\\mathbf{k}n_{s}(\\mathbf{k})+\\cdots.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTreating the last three terms as \\(n_s(\\mathbf{k})\\), our excitation energy changes to first order in \\(\\delta\\mathbf{k}\\) by an amount\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta E &= \\sum_{\\mathbf{k},s} n_{s}(\\mathbf{k})\\delta\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\nabla_\\mathbf{k}\\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k}) \\nonumber\\\\\n&+\\frac{1}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, s,\\mathbf{k}', s'} f_{s^{}s'}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')n_{s}(\\mathbf{k})\\left[\\delta(k_F-\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}'}\\rvert)\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}'\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{k}- \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}'}n_{s'}(\\mathbf{k}')\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{k}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n(In the first term I have integrated by parts.) On grounds of Galilean invariance, however, we also know that this is\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{\\mathbf{P}}{m}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{k},\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere the total momentum \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) can be written\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k},s} \\mathbf{k}n_{s}(\\mathbf{k}).\n\\]\nIf Equation 9 holds for all \\(n_s(\\mathbf{k})\\) and \\(\\delta\\mathbf{k}\\), we have (ignoring second order in \\(n_s(\\mathbf{k})\\))\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{m} = \\nabla_\\mathbf{k}\\varepsilon_s(\\mathbf{k}) +  \\sum_{s'}\\int  f_{s^{}s'}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k}')\\delta(k_F-\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}'}\\rvert)\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}' \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}'}{(2\\pi)^3}.\n\\]\nRestricting ourselves to momenta close to the Fermi surface, and using our definitions Equation 6, Equation 7 and Equation 8 gives the relation\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{m} = \\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{m_*} +\\frac{1}{m} \\int F(\\phi) \\mathbf{k}' \\frac{d\\Omega_{\\mathbf{k}'}}{4\\pi}.\n\\]\nIf we write \\(\\mathbf{k}'=\\cos\\phi \\mathbf{k}+ \\sin\\phi \\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\), with \\(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp\\cdot\\mathbf{k}=0\\), this gives Landau’s famous result\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} = \\frac{1}{m_*} +\\frac{1}{m} \\int F(\\phi) \\cos\\phi \\frac{\\sin\\phi d\\phi}{2}.\n\\]\nFor the \\(F(\\phi)\\) that we found in Equation 5 from second order perturbation theory, this gives the effective mass correction\n\\[\n\\frac{m_*}{m} = 1 + \\frac{1}{30\\pi^4}(7\\log 2 - 1)\\left(mU_0k_\\text{F}\\right)^2+\\cdots.\n\\]\n(Use the substitution \\(u=\\sin\\phi/2\\) to do the integral.) Again, the point is not the value that we’ve obtained, but the argument we used to do so. In systems with strong interactions it’s possible for the effective mass to be very different from the bare mass: in the heavy fermion materials \\(m_*/m\\) can approach 1000! Despite being so far from the noninteracting limit, Landau’s picture of fermionic quasiparticles still applies.",

    "section": "3 Eigenstates in Perturbation Theory: What is a Quasiparticle?",
    "text": "3 Eigenstates in Perturbation Theory: What is a Quasiparticle?\nSo far we’ve focused on the energies of the excited states of the gas. But what do these quasiparticle states look like? In perturbation theory at least, we can see fairly explicitly. At first order we have\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}^{(1)}}\\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{N}'\\neq \\mathbf N}\\frac{\\langle{\\mathbf{N'}}\\rvert H_\\text{int} \\lvert \\mathbf{N} \\rangle}{E^{(0)}(\\mathbf{N})-E^{(0)}(\\mathbf{N}')}\\lvert{\\mathbf{N}'}\\rangle.\n\\]\nLet’s consider the Fermi sea ground state \\(\\lvert{\\text{FS}}\\rangle\\). What states can appear in the above sum in this case? The only possibility is that the interaction creates two particle-hole pairs out of the Fermi sea, with total momentum zero.\n\n\n\nTwo particle-hole pairs created out of the Fermi sea.\n\n\n\\[\n\\lvert{0}\\rangle=\\lvert{\\text{FS}}\\rangle+\\text{two particle-hole pair states}+\\cdots\n\\]\nWhat about an excited state? Consider the state\n\\[\na^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s}\\lvert{\\text{FS}}\\rangle,\n\\]\nhaving momentum \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and spin \\(s\\). When the interactions are switched on, this state will be modified to a state we’ll denote \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k},s}\\rangle\\). At first order, two kinds of states can contribute to the modifed state:\n\nStates with a pair of particle-hole pairs, as before, but with the extra particle at \\(\\mathbf{k}\\). The coefficients of these states are the same as for the corresponding states in the correction for \\(\\lvert{0}\\rangle\\), as you should check.\nStates with a single particle-hole pair and with the extra particle moved from \\(\\mathbf{k}\\)​ to another momentum.\n\n\n\n\nParticle scatters, creating a particle-hole pair.\n\n\nLet’s compare \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k},s}\\rangle\\) with \\(a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s}\\lvert{0}\\rangle\\), the state obtained by creating a particle in the exact ground state of the problem. In first order perturbation theory, \\(\\lvert{0}\\rangle\\) includes the first kind of state above (2 particle-hole pair states). The states only differ because of the contribution of the second kind. To first order, the single quasiparticle state is therefore\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\lvert{\\mathbf{k},s}\\rangle &= \\sqrt{\\frac{z_k}{\\langle{0}\\rvert a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k},s}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s} \\lvert 0 \\rangle}}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s}\\lvert{0}\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\\n&\\qquad + \\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\substack{\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}\\\\ s,s'}}\\frac{a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_1,s}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_2,s'}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_3,s'}\\lvert{\\text{FS}}\\rangle}{\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_1)+\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})},\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sqrt{z_k}\\) is a normalization factor. As we go to successively higher orders of perturbation theory, the quasiparticle state is ‘dressed’ with more particle-hole pairs. The quasiparticle retains the conserved quantum numbers (momentum and spin in this case) of the fermions of the noninteracting theory.\nNormalizing Equation 10 gives\n\\[\nz_\\mathbf{k}= 1 - \\left(\\frac{U_0}{V}\\right)^2\\sum_{\\substack{\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}\\\\\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_3}\\rvert&lt;k_\\text{F},\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_2}\\rvert,\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}_1}\\rvert&gt;k_\\text{F}\\\\ s,s'}}\\frac{1}{\\left[\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_1)+\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_2)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}_3)-\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})\\right]^2}+\\cdots.\n\\tag{11}\\]\nThis quantity can be interpreted in terms of the overlap of the single quasiparticle state \\(\\lvert{\\mathbf{k},s}\\rangle\\) with \\(a^\\dagger_{s,\\mathbf{k}}\\lvert{0}\\rangle\\).\n\\[\nz_\\mathbf{k}= \\frac{\\lvert{\\langle{\\mathbf{k},s}\\rvert a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s} \\lvert 0 \\rangle}\\rvert^2}{\\langle{0}\\rvert a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k},s}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s} \\lvert 0 \\rangle}\n\\]\nA finite overlap – evaluated for quasiparticles at the Fermi surface – is a requirement for the Fermi liquid picture to hold. If it were to vanish, any resemblance of the quasiparticle to a free fermion would disappear with it!\nObviously evaluating the integrals in Equation 11 is a challenge involving a double integral over momentum, but I have it on good authority (see Abrikosov, Gorkov, and Dzyaloshinski (2012), though they don’t give the details) that the answer is\n\\[\nz_{\\lvert{\\mathbf{k}}\\rvert=k_\\text{F}} = 1 - \\frac{(mUk_\\text{F})^2}{8\\pi^4}\\left[\\log 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right]\n\\]\nThis is also the occupation number of the original fermions \\(\\langle{0}\\rvert a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k},s} \\lvert 0 \\rangle\\) (not the quasiparticles!) just below the Fermi surface in the ground state (see Problem Set 3. There is a corresponding result just above. Even with interactions, there is a finite step in the distribution function at the Fermi surface.\n\n\n\nDiscontinutity in the ground state occupation number.",

    "text": "4 Collisions\nThe picture we have developed so far of eigenstates labelled by quasiparticle occupations is actually a bit of an oversimplification. When we apply the second order perturbation theory formula Equation 1 we have to omit degenerate states. It isn’t really enough to insist that the occupancies differ \\(\\mathbf{N}'\\neq \\mathbf N\\), because many states with different occupancies have the same energy in the thermodynamic limit. From a time-dependent point of view, the interaction can cause transitions between these states, leading to the quasiparticle distribution changing over time. The rate of these transitions can be described by the Fermi golden rule.\n\\[\n\\Gamma_{\\mathbf{N}\\to\\mathbf{N'}} = 2\\pi \\lvert{\\langle{\\mathbf{N'}}\\rvert H_\\text{int} \\lvert \\mathbf{N} \\rangle}\\rvert^2 \\delta(E(\\mathbf{N})-E(\\mathbf{N}'))\n\\]\nBy considering the volume of phase space available for the scattering of a quasiparticle of energy \\(\\Delta\\) above the Fermi surface, you should be able to argue that the total rate, obtained by integrating over all possible final states, varies like \\(\\Delta^2\\). This means that at low energy (or temperature) such scattering is ineffective and the Landau picture holds.\n\n\n\nVanishing phase space volume at low energies.",

    "section": "1 Bosons as Fermion Pairs",
    "text": "1 Bosons as Fermion Pairs\nSo far, we have discussed Bose–Einstein condensation and superfluidity using models of bosonic particles. Can systems of fermions display the same phenomena? Experimentally, we already know that the answer must be yes, as an atom of He\\(^4\\) consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons – two of each – which are are all fermions. A He\\(^4\\) atom is a composite boson, but in many situations its internal structure is of no relevance.\nTo return to model systems, consider the Fermi gas Hamiltonian that we discussed in the last lecture\n\\[\nH = \\int d\\mathbf{r}\\left[ \\sum_{s=\\uparrow,\\downarrow}\\frac{1}{2m}\\nabla\\psi^\\dagger_s\\cdot\\nabla\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_s + U_0 \\psi^\\dagger_\\uparrow\\psi^\\dagger_\\downarrow\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\downarrow\\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\uparrow\\right].\n\\tag{1}\\]\nFor a pair of particles of opposite spin, this is equivalent to\n\\[\nH = -\\frac{1}{2m}\\left[\\nabla_1^2+\\nabla_2^2\\right] + U_0\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2).\n\\]\nFor \\(U_0&lt;0\\) and sufficiently large, we expect a bound state to form with a symmetric spatial wavefunction and a spin singlet. Now consider a dilute gas of such bound pairs. ‘Dilute’ in this context means that the interparticle separation is large compared to the size of the bound state. In this limit, we expect to be able to treat the bound pairs as spinless bosons, which can then display all the usual phenomena associated with Bose gases.\nThe idea that superfluidity can arise in a system of fermions as a result of pairing was conjectured to explain the phenomenon of superconductivity in metals at low temperatures Schafroth (1954). If electrons could form pairs, then superconductivity could be understood as superfluidity of charge \\(-2e\\) bosons. Job done.\nYou may have spotted the problem with this idea: electrons actually repel each other due to the Coulomb interaction. A realistic description of electron pairing must involve a mechanism for attractive interactions. The 1957 realization of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) was that such an attraction is provided by the coupling of the electrons to phonons. For states near the Fermi surface, this attraction can actually overcome the Coulomb repulsion (once screening is accounted for, see Lecture 12. Problem Set 3 describes how this can occur in a simple model.\nThis is still not the whole story. The net attraction between electrons is still not strong enough to form a bound state, if we were just to consider isolated pair. BCS showed that in a gas of fermions at finite density, arbitrarily weak attraction is enough to cause pairing: it is a truly many body phenomenon. This was first demonstrated by Leon Cooper using a toy model that accounted for the existence of the Fermi sea in the pairing problem, and for this reason we speak of Cooper pairs.\nSo BCS got the Nobel prize (which conveniently can be split three ways) and their theory become one of the pillars of condensed matter physics. In this lecture we’ll discuss BCS theory using the model Hamiltonian Equation 1 with attractive short-ranged interactions. This is not a particularly realistic model of the combined phonon-mediated attraction and screened Coulomb repulsion, but displays the same physics. It is a good model for pairing of ultracold fermionic atoms, first observed in 2004 Regal, Greiner, and Jin (2004).",

    "text": "2 BCS Theory\n\n2.1 The BCS Wavefunction\nIn momentum space our Hamiltonian Equation 1 has the form\n\\[\nH =\\sum_{\\mathbf{k},s} \\epsilon(\\mathbf{k})a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k},s}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k},s} + \\overbrace{\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}_1+\\mathbf{k}_2=\\mathbf{k}_3+\\mathbf{k}_4} a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_1,\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{k}_2,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_3,\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{k}_4,\\uparrow}}^{\\equiv H_\\text{int}},\n\\]\nWe take the interaction between the two species to be attractive \\(U_0&lt;0\\). The ground state of the non-interacting problem is\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\text{FS}}\\rangle=\\prod_{|\\mathbf{p}|&lt;k_\\text{F}} a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle.\n\\]\nThe application of the interaction Hamiltonian \\(H_\\text{int}\\) generates terms of the form\n\\[\na^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}+\\mathbf{q}\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{p}'\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}'+\\mathbf{q}\\uparrow}\\lvert{\\text{FS}}\\rangle.\\qquad |\\mathbf{p}|,|\\mathbf{p}+\\mathbf{q}|&gt;k_\\text{F},\\, |\\mathbf{p}'|,|\\mathbf{p}'+\\mathbf{q}|&lt;k_\\text{F}.\n\\]\nNote the difference from the Bose case: because the state \\(\\mathbf{p}=0\\) plays no special role – like every other state below the Fermi surface it is occupied with one fermion of each species – we do not just create pair excitations with zero centre of mass momentum \\(\\mathbf{q}=0\\). Nevertheless, the BCS theory makes the assumption that the ground state involves a superposition of zero momentum pairs only. We can write such a state very generally as \\[\n\\lvert{\\text{pair}}\\rangle\\equiv\\sum_{\\sum_\\mathbf{p}n^P_\\mathbf{p}=N/2} c_{\\{n^P_{\\mathbf{p}}\\}} \\prod_{\\mathbf{p}}\\left[a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}\\right]^\n{n_{\\mathbf{p}}}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere the numbers \\(n_{\\mathbf{p}}^P\\) are either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) (why?). Note that in writing Equation 2 the number of each species is assumed to be exactly \\(N/2\\). Restricting ourselves to states of this form means that \\[\n\\langle{\\text{pair}}\\rvert H_\\text{int} \\lvert \\text{pair} \\rangle = \\frac{U_0}{V}N_\\uparrow N_\\downarrow+\\langle{\\text{pair}}\\rvert \\tilde H_{\\text{int}} \\lvert \\text{pair} \\rangle,\n\\] where the first term is the Hartree–Fock energy and \\[\n\\tilde H_{\\text{int}}=\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{p}'}a^\\dagger_\n{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{p}'\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}'\\uparrow},\n\\label{super_bcsH}\n\\]\nIt’s useful to introduce the operator \\(b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}=a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\n\\downarrow}\\) and its conjugate \\(b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}=a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{p},\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}\\), that respectively create and destroy a \\(\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow,-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow\\right)\\) pair. Because our pair ansatz Equation 2 only includes amplitudes for a given \\(\\left(+\\mathbf{p},-\\mathbf{p}\\right)\\) pair of momenta having either none or two fermions, we can compute expectations using the pair Hamiltonian \\[\nH_{\\text{pair}}=2\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}}\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{p}}b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}+\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{p}'} b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}\nb^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}'},\n\\tag{3}\\] where \\(2b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}= a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p},\\uparrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p},\\uparrow}+a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p},\\downarrow}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{-\\mathbf{p},\\downarrow}\\) on paired states.\nNow, can we solve Equation 3? This may now look like a quadratic problem, but the pair operators \\(b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}\\), while commuting at different momenta \\[\n[b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p},b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}'}]=[b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p},b^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}'}]=[b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p},b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}'}]=0\\qquad \\mathbf{p}\\neq\\mathbf{p}',\n\\]\nobey the hardcore constraint\n\\[\n(b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p})^2=0,\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhich is a result of \\(b^\\dagger\\) being composed of a pair of fermions obeying the exclusion principle. Nevertheless, given that a pair that `hops’ into a level at \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) could come from any other level \\(\\mathbf{p}'\\), it seems reasonable to try, as a variational state, one in which the amplitudes for the occupancy of each level are uncorrelated\n\\[\n\\lvert{N \\text{ pair}}\\rangle\\equiv\\left[\\sum_\\mathbf{p}c_\\mathbf{p}b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}\\right]^{N/2}\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\n\\tag{5}\\]\ncorresponding to Equation 2 but with a set of coefficients \\(c_{\\{n^P_\\mathbf{p}\\}}\\) that factorizes. Finding the variational energy of Equation 5 is still a tricky problem. For instance, what is the expectation value of the kinetic energy?\n\\[\n\\mathrm{K.E}=2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{p}}\\langle b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle\\equiv 2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{p}} \\langle n^P_\n\\mathbf{p}\\rangle,\n\\tag{6}\\]\nFinding the average number of pairs \\(\\langle n^P_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle\\) in Equation 5 is however not obvious. Instead, we follow the route taken by BCS, and consider instead the normalized wavefunction\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\text{BCS}}\\rangle =\\prod_\\mathbf{p}\\left[v_\\mathbf{p}b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}+u_\\mathbf{p}\\right]\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle\\qquad |u_\\mathbf{p}|^2+|v_\\mathbf{p}|\n^2=1.\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThis is a superposition of states with different total number of particles. Apart from the overall normalization, the projection of Equation 7 onto a fixed number \\(N\\) of particles corresponds exactly to Equation 5 if \\(c_\\mathbf{p}=v_\\mathbf{p}/u_\\mathbf{p}\\). Since Equation 7 is a product of factors corresponding to each momentum separately, \\(\\langle n^P_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle\\) is easily found to be \\(v_\\mathbf{p}^2\\). The total variational energy of this state is\n\\[\n\\langle{\\text{BCS}}\\rvert H \\lvert \\text{BCS} \\rangle=2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{p}}|v_\\mathbf{p}|^2+\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{p}'}u^*_\\mathbf{p}v_\n\\mathbf{p}u_{\\mathbf{p}'}v^*_{\\mathbf{p}'}.\n\\tag{8}\\]\nWhat about our use of a non-conserving wavefunction? The expectation value of any operator that itself conserves the number of particles can evidently be written\n\\[\n\\langle{\\text{BCS}}\\rvert \\mathcal{O} \\lvert \\text{BCS} \\rangle=\\sum_N P_N \\langle{N \\text{ pair}}\\rvert \\mathcal{O} \\lvert N\\text{ pair} \\rangle,\n\\]\nThe probabilities \\(P_N\\) are\n\\[\nP_N=\\sum_{\\sum n^P_\\mathbf{p}=N/2}\\prod_\\mathbf{p}\\left[n^P_\\mathbf{p}|v_\\mathbf{p}|^2+\\left(1-n^P_\\mathbf{p}\\right)|u_\\mathbf{p}|^2 \\right],\n\\]\nwhich is strongly peaked around \\(\\langle N \\rangle=2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}|v_\\mathbf{p}|^2=2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\langle n^P_\\mathbf{p}\n\\rangle\\), with a variance that is \\(O(N)\\). Thus at large \\(N\\)\n\\[\n\\langle{\\text{BCS}}\\rvert \\mathcal{O} \\lvert \\text{BCS} \\rangle\\to \\langle{\\langle N\\rangle \\text{ pair}}\\rvert \\mathcal{O} \\lvert \\langle N\\rangle\\text{ pair} \\rangle.\n\\]\nIn the thermodynamic limit, we might as well work with the non-conserving form Equation 7. To fix the number of particles, we should introduce a chemical potential into the Hamiltonian. Note that we didn’t have to do this with the Bogoliubov theory as we fixed the number of particles in the condensate \\(N_0\\).\nThere is an interesting alternative interpretation of the pair Hamiltonian Equation 3. Acting within the pair subspace, the three operators \\(b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}\\), \\(b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}\\), and \\(b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}-1/2\\) behave as the components of a spin-\\(1/2\\)\n\\[\nS_\\mathbf{p}^+ \\equiv b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p},\\quad S_\\mathbf{p}^- \\equiv b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p},\\quad S^z_\\mathbf{p}= b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}-1/2,\n\\]\non account of the commutation relations\n\\[\n\\left[b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p},b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}\\right]=2\\left(b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}-1/2\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\n\\left[b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p},\\left(b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_\\mathbf{p}-1/2\\right)\\right]=-b^\\dagger_\\mathbf{p}.\n\\]\nThis representation is sometimes called Anderson spins. In this way we can write Equation 3 as a spin chain\n\\[\nH_{\\text{pair}}-\\mu N=2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\xi({\\mathbf{p}})S_\\mathbf{p}^z+\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{p}'}S^+_\\mathbf{p}S^-_{\\mathbf{p}'},\n\\]\nwhere we have included the chemical potential by defining \\(\\xi_\\mathbf{p}\\equiv\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})-\\mu\\). If we parameterize \\(\\left(u_\\mathbf{p},v_\\mathbf{p}\\right)\\) as \\((\\cos(\\theta/2)e^{-i\\varphi/2},\\sin(\\theta/2)e^{i\\varphi/2})\\) then the variational energy Equation 8 has the form (except for a constant)\n\\[\n\\langle{\\text{BCS}}\\rvert H \\lvert \\text{BCS} \\rangle=-\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\xi_\\mathbf{p}\\cos\\theta_\\mathbf{p}+\\frac{U_0}{4V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{p}'}\\sin\n\\theta_\\mathbf{p}\\sin\\theta_{\\mathbf{p}'}\\cos\\left(\\varphi_\\mathbf{p}-\\varphi_{\\mathbf{p}'}\\right).\n\\tag{9}\\]\nThe interpretation of Equation 9 is the following. The first term tends to align the spins with the z-axis in the - direction for \\(\\xi_\\mathbf{p}&lt;0\\) and in the + direction for \\(\\xi_\\mathbf{p}&gt;0\\). On the other hand, the second term, originating from the potential energy between the constituents of a pair, wants the spins to lie in the x-y plane. Of course, the spins are really quantum mechanical spin-1/2 operators. The direction corresponds to the direction of \\(\\langle \\mathbf{S}\\rangle\\) in the BCS state.\nIt remains to actually minimize the energy Equation 8 to determine the \\(u\\)’s and \\(v\\)’s, or equivalently, the configurations of the spins. For \\(U_0&gt;0\\) (repulsive interactions), the spins all point in the \\(\\pm z\\) direction, forming a ‘domain wall’ where \\(\\xi_{\\mathbf{p}}\\) changes sign at the Fermi surface. The relationship between the spin picture and the average number of pairs is\n\\[\n\\langle n^P_{\\mathbf{p}}\\rangle=v_\\mathbf{p}^2=\\left[1-\\cos\\theta_\\mathbf{p}\\right]/2,\n\\]\nso we see that this corresponds simply to a sharp fermi step. For \\(U_0&lt;0\\), the system can lower its energy by taking \\(\\sin\\theta_\\mathbf{p}\\neq 0\\). The lowering of the interaction energy more than compensates the increase in kinetic energy that comes from smearing the step, see Equation 6. Clearly all of the angles \\(\\varphi_\\mathbf{p}\\), describing the angle in the x-y plane, should be equal. Taking the extremum of Equation 9 with respect to the angles \\(\\theta_{\\mathbf{p}}\\) gives the condition\n\n\n\nAnderson spin configurations and the associated distribution functions for the free fermi gas (top) and the BCS state (bottom).\n\n\n\\[\n\\xi_{\\mathbf{p}}\\sin\\theta_\\mathbf{p}-|\\Delta|\\cos\\theta_\\mathbf{p}=0,\n\\]\nwhere it is convenient to introduce the gap parameter\n\\[\n\\Delta=-\\frac{U_0}{2V}\\sum_\\mathbf{p}e^{i\\varphi}\\sin\\theta_\\mathbf{p}=-\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_\\mathbf{p}u_\\mathbf{p}v^*_\\mathbf{p}.\n\\]\nThus we have\n\\[\n\\cos\\theta_\\mathbf{p}=\\frac{\\xi_{\\mathbf{p}}}{E_\\mathbf{p}},\\qquad \\sin\\theta_\\mathbf{p}=\\frac{|\\Delta|}{E_\\mathbf{p}}, \\qquad E_\\mathbf{p}=\\sqrt{\\xi\n(\\mathbf{p})^2+|\\Delta|^2}.\n\\]\nThe meaning of these solutions is very simple. They correspond to the alignment of the spin vector with the direction of the effective `magnetic field’\n\\[\n\\left(\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\Delta.\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Delta,\\xi_\\mathbf{p}\\right)\n\\tag{10}\\]\nTo be self-consistent, the solution must further satisfy the gap equation\n\\[\n\\Delta=-\\frac{U_0}{2V}\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\frac{\\Delta}{E_\\mathbf{p}}.\n\\tag{11}\\]\nIt is clear that for \\(U_0&gt;0\\) there are no non-trivial solutions (\\(\\Delta=0\\) always), while for any \\(U_0&lt;0\\) there is always a solution at finite \\(\\Delta\\) (One can also show that it corresponds to a minimum of energy. In the repulsive case, the solution at \\(\\Delta=0\\), which always exists, corresponds to a maximum). Passing to the continuum limit we have\n\\[\n\\Delta=-\\frac{U_0}{2}\\int \\frac{d\\mathbf{p}}{\\left(2\\pi\\right)^3} \\frac{\\Delta}{E_\\mathbf{p}}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nThis integral is divergent in the ultraviolet. We turn to the question of how to regularize it in the next section. More significant, however, is the dependence of the right hand side on \\(\\Delta\\) for small $ $. This is\n\\[\n\\sim-\\frac{U_0}{2}\\nu(\\mu)\\Delta\\log \\Lambda/\\Delta,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Lambda\\) is the UV cut-off (we will shortly identify it with the Fermi energy), and \\(\\nu(\\mu)\\) is the density of states per spin component at the chemical potential. This shows that no matter how small the attraction \\(U_0&lt;0\\), there will always be a solution of Equation 12 with finite \\(\\Delta\\). This is the essence of the Cooper phenomenon. It should be compared with the situation in which there are not a macroscopically large number of particles present. In that case \\(\\mu=0\\), so that \\(\\xi_{\\mathbf{p}}=\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p})&gt;0\\). Then the right hand side of Equation 12 has no divergence at low energies because the density of states \\(\\nu(E)\\) vanishes. The finite value of \\(\\Delta\\) is thus seen to be a consequence of the fermi sea.\nWe have shown that the BCS state, consisting of a superposition of zero momentum pairs, is a better variational state than the Fermi sea for arbitrarily weak attractive interactions. Further, it coincides with the Fermi sea at zero interaction, suggesting a smooth evolution of the ground state as interactions are switched on. What, if anything, does this have to do with the strong coupling picture of tightly bound bosonic pairs in a dilute gas that we gave in the introduction?\n\n\n2.2 Discussion: Heisenberg’s Problem\n\n\n2.3 The BCS-BEC Crossover\nSurprisingly, the wavefunctions in the two limits are the same! This can be seen from the first quantized form of the number conserving wavefunction Equation 5\n\\[\n\\lvert{N \\text{ pair}}\\rangle=\\sum_P (-1)^P \\prod_{i,j=1}^{N/2} \\varphi(\\mathbf{r}^\\uparrow_{i}-\\mathbf{r}^\\downarrow_{P(j)}),\n\\tag{13}\\]\nwhere \\(\\varphi_\\mathbf{p}=v_\\mathbf{p}/u_\\mathbf{p}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{r}^{\\uparrow,\\downarrow}_j\\) are the positions of the spin up and spin down fermions, and we sum over all permutations of \\(N/2\\) objects (assuming \\(N\\) is even).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\n\n\n\nDo you understand where this comes from?\n\n\nAt weak coupling the extent of the `pair wavefunction’ \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\) is large compared to the separation between pairs. In this limit the antisymmetrization operation, required by the exclusion principle, plays a dominant role, as we have seen. When the pair wavefunction \\(\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})\\) has a much smaller extent than the typical separation between pairs, we can expect that the antisymmetrization operation in Equation 13 is not too important, as two fermions of the same type rarely overlap. In this limit, any given momentum state has a low average occupancy, and the hardcore constraint Equation 4 does not play a significant role. Then Equation 3 can really be thought of as a Hamiltonian for isolated pairs, with the corresponding binding energy. The resulting wavefunction is then essentially a Gross-Pitaevskii state of molecules. This all suggests that the BCS state is smoothly connected to the Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC), though the BCS-BEC crossover.\nTo see how this works in detail we need to address the issue of regularizing Equation 11. The details are given in the Appendix, but the conclusion is very simple. The gap equation can be written in terms of the scattering length \\(a\\) (if you haven’t met scattering theory before, the meaning of this quantity is explained in the Appendix too) of the two-particle potential instead of interaction strength \\(U_0\\)\n\\[\n-\\frac{m}{4\\pi a}\\Delta=\\frac{1}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}}\\left[\\frac{\\Delta}{2E_{\\mathbf{p}'}}-\\frac{\\Delta}\n{2\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{p}'}}\\right].\n\\tag{14}\\]\nThe nice thing about this new equation is that, on account of the second term in the square brackets, the ultraviolet divergence has been eliminated.\nIn the weak-coupling limit, the gap \\(\\Delta\\) is expected to be much smaller than the Fermi energy, and the chemical potential is just equal to the Fermi energy \\(E_F=k_\\text{F}^2/2m\\). The integral in Equation 14 can then be done explicitly to give the gap\n\\[\n\\Delta_{\\mathrm{BCS}}=\\frac{8}{e^2}E_F\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{2|k_\\text{F} a|}\\right]\n\\tag{15}\\]\nOutside of the weak-coupling limit, we have to account for a change in the chemical potential, in order to keep a fixed density. This is apparent from the equation\n\\[\nN=2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\langle n^P_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle=2\\sum_\\mathbf{p}v_{\\mathbf{p}}^2=\\sum_\\mathbf{p}\\left[1-\\frac{\\xi_{\\mathbf{p}}}{E_\\mathbf{p}}\\right]\n\\tag{16}\\]\nThe two equations Equation 14 and Equation 16 are conveniently cast in the dimensionless form\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\pi}{2k_\\text{F} a}=\\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\left[1-\\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{(x^2-\\mu)^2+\\Delta_0^2}} \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}=\\int_0^{\\infty} dx\\, x^2\\left[1-\\frac{x^2-\\mu}{\\sqrt{(x^2-\\mu)^2+\\Delta_0^2}}\\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Delta_0\\) are measured in units of \\(E_F=p_F^2/2m\\), and the unit of length is \\(k_\\text{F}^{-1}\\). In these units the total density of particles of both types is \\(1/3\\pi^2\\).\n Variation of gap and chemical potential accross the BCS (left, weak attraction) to BEC (right, strong attraction).\nThe point \\(1/k_\\text{F}a=0\\), where the scattering length diverges, corresponds to the formation of a bound state. This is an interesting part of the phase diagram, because here (if the temperature is zero) there is only one energy scale (the Fermi energy) and only one length scale (the fermi wavelength). All quantities such as \\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\mu\\) are simply some universal fraction of the Fermi energy. In particular the equation of state of the system is\n\\[\nE/V=\\alpha\\frac{3}{5}E_Fn\\propto n^{5/3}.\n\\]\nThe numerical factors are to emphasize the resemblance of the unitary gas to the free fermi gas, where \\(\\alpha=1\\). The mean field theory above gives \\(\\alpha=0.59\\), while a Quantum Monte Carlo calculation found \\(\\alpha=0.44\\pm0.01\\). There is of course no reason to believe the quantitative predictions of the mean-field theory in the region where interactions are so strong.\n\n\n2.4 Quasiparticle Excitations\nLike the Bogoliubov theory, this BCS theory also lets us discuss excitations out of the ground state. We didn’t solve the BCS hamiltonian by a Bogoliubov transformation, as is often done, but we can introduce the Bogoliubov-type excitations after the fact. Recalling the BCS state \\[\n\\lvert{\\text{BCS}}\\rangle =\\prod_\\mathbf{p}\\left[v_\\mathbf{p}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}+u_\\mathbf{p}\\right]\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\n\\]\nit’s easy to see that the operators\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\alpha^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}&=&u_\\mathbf{p}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}-v_\\mathbf{p}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}\\nonumber\\\\\n\\alpha^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}&=&u_{-\\mathbf{p}}a^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}+v_{-\\mathbf{p}}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow},\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\]\nsatisfy the canonical fermion anticommutation relations and annihilate the BCS state\n\\[\n\\alpha^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_{\\mathbf{p},s}\\lvert{\\text{BCS}}\\rangle\\rangle=0.\n\\]\nConsider the state\n\\[\n\\lvert{\\mathbf{p},s}\\rangle=\\alpha^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p},s}\\lvert{\\text{BCS}}\\rangle=a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p},s}\\prod_{\\mathbf{p}'\\neq \\mathbf{p}} \\left[v_{\\mathbf{p}'}a^\\dagger_\n{\\mathbf{p}'\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}'\\downarrow}+u_{\\mathbf{p}'}\\right]\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\n\\]\ncorresponding to the momentum state \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) certainly containing one particle with (pseudo-)spin \\(s\\), and the \\(\\left(-\\mathbf{p},-s\\right)\\) state certainly being empty. The result is an eigenstate of momentum and spin, but is it an energy eigenstate, and thus a sharply defined excitation? Note that if we chose \\(s=\\uparrow\\) so that the \\(\\left(\\mathbf{p},\\uparrow\\right)\\) state is certainly occupied it means that \\(a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\n\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}\\lvert{\\mathbf{p},\\uparrow}\\rangle=0\\), so that the corresponding term no longer appears in the interaction term when it is applied to this state. The level is said to be `blocked’. Thus it certainly is an eigenstate of the pair problem, if \\(\\lvert{\\text{BCS}}\\rangle\\) is. What is its energy? We have to take into account the kinetic energy as well as the loss of attractive interaction energy, see Equation 9\n\\[\nE_{s}(\\mathbf{p})=\\xi_{\\mathbf{p}}[\\overbrace{\\left(1-\\langle n^P_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle\\right)}^{\\left(\\mathbf{p},s\\right)\\,\\mathrm{occupied}}\n\\overbrace{-\\langle n^P_\\mathbf{p}\\rangle}^{\\left(-\\mathbf{p},-s\\right)\\,\\mathrm{empty}}]+\\overbrace{\\Delta\\sin\\theta_\n\\mathbf{p}}^{\\mathrm{`blocking'}}=E_{\\mathbf{p}}\n\\]\nNote that these quasiparticle excitations always have a gap \\(\\Delta_{s}\\) given by\n\\[\n\\Delta_s=\\min_\\mathbf{p}E_\\mathbf{p}=\\begin{cases}\n\\Delta, & \\mu&gt;0,\\\\\n\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+\\mu^2},&  \\mu&lt;0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAs \\(\\mu\\) turns from positive to negative as we pass from BCS to BEC (see the above figure, the density of states of the quasiparticle excitations turns from having a square root singularity \\(\\nu(\\epsilon)\\sim \\left(\\epsilon-\\Delta_s\\right)^{-1/2}\\) to vanishing like a square root \\(\\nu(\\epsilon)\\sim \\left(\\epsilon-\\Delta_s\\right)^{1/2}\\).",

To see why this is so, consider the two particle Schrödinger equation\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2m}\\left[\\nabla_1^2+\\nabla^2\\right]\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) + U(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2)=E\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2),\n\\]\nnow with a general two-body potential \\(U(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2)\\). In terms of the relative coordinate \\(\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2\\) this becomes\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{m}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) + U(\\mathbf{r})\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})=E\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}),\n\\]\ncorresponding to a reduced mass of \\(\\mu = m/2\\). In scattering problems we look for solutions of the form\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\Psi_\\text{free}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\Psi_\\text{scatt}(\\mathbf{r}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Psi_\\text{free}(\\mathbf{r})\\) solves the free particle equation, giving the inhomogenous equation for \\(\\Psi_\\text{scatt}(\\mathbf{r})\\)\n\\[\n\\left[E-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{m}\\right]\\Psi_\\text{scatt}(\\mathbf{r}) + U(\\mathbf{r})\\Psi_\\text{scatt}(\\mathbf{r})=-U(\\mathbf{r})\\Psi_\\text{free}(\\mathbf{r}).\n\\tag{17}\\]\nIt is a standard result of scattering theory that the zero energy wavefunction as the form\n\\[\n\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})\\xrightarrow{|\\mathbf{r}|\\gg r_0} \\overbrace{1}^{\\Psi_\\text{free}} - \\overbrace{\\frac{a}{|\\mathbf{r}|}}^{\\Psi_\\text{scatt}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is the (s-wave) scattering length, and \\(r_0\\) is the range of the potential. This corresponds to the behaviour in Fourier space\n\\[\n\\tilde\\Psi_\\text{scatt}(\\mathbf{k})\\xrightarrow{|\\mathbf{k}|\\ll r_0^{-1}} \\frac{4\\pi a}{|\\mathbf{k}|^2}\n\\]\nReturning to the BCS problem, it’s not hard to see that with a general potential the gap parameter is now momentum dependent, leading to a gap equation\n\\[\n\\Delta_\\mathbf{p}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\frac{d\\mathbf{p}'}{(2\\pi)^3}\\tilde U(\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p}')\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathbf{p}'}}{E_{\\mathbf{p}'}}.\n\\tag{18}\\]\nThe solution of Equation 18 is in general very difficult, but it can be greatly simplified if we assume that the range of the potential \\(U(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the shortest length scale in the problem. With this assumption we can write Equation 11\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta_\\mathbf{p}+\\frac{1}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}'}U(\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p}')\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathbf{p}'}}{2\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{p}'}}&=-\\frac{1}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}'} \\left[U_0(\\mathbf{p})\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathbf{p}'}}{2E_{\\mathbf{p}'}}-U(\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p}')\\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathbf{p}'}}{2\\epsilon_\n{\\mathbf{p}'}}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\n&=-\\frac{U_0(\\mathbf{p})}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}'} \\left[\\frac{\\Delta_{0}}{2E_{\\mathbf{p}'}}-\\frac{\\Delta_{0}}{2\\epsilon_\n{\\mathbf{p}'}}\\right].\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{19}\\]\nWe have added the same term to both sides. However, the integral on the right hand side converges on a scale set by the momentum corresponding to the larger of \\(\\Delta_\\mathbf{p}\\) or \\(\\mu\\), which by assumption is much less than the scale on which \\(U_0(\\mathbf{p})\\) varies, and justifies replacing \\(U_0(\\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p}')\\) with \\(U_0(\\mathbf{p})\\), and \\(\\Delta_{\\mathbf{p}'}\\) with \\(\\Delta_0\\).\nBy comparing the Fourier transform of Equation 17 at \\(E=0\\) and Equation 19, we can conclude\n\\[\n\\Delta_\\mathbf{p}=\\frac{\\Delta_0\\mathbf{p}^2}{4\\pi a} \\tilde\\Psi_\\text{scatt}(\\mathbf{p}),\n\\]\nso that\n\\[\n-\\frac{m}{4\\pi a}\\Delta_0=\\frac{1}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}}\\left[\\frac{\\Delta_{0}}{2E_{\\mathbf{p}'}}-\\frac{\\Delta_{0}}\n{2\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{p}'}}\\right].\n\\]\nWhich coincides with Equation 14 (we drop the subscript \\(0\\) from now on, as we never need to discuss the high momentum behaviour of \\(\\Delta_\\mathbf{p}\\) again).\n\n\n3.2 The Effect of Temperature\nWhen we discussed the quasiparticle excitations, we didn’t account for the effect that they have on the self-consistent equation. This is fine when there are few excitations in the system, but when many levels are blocked, we have to take this effect into account, leading to a reduction in the gap parameter. The obvious example of this effect is a system at finite temperature, where the quasiparticles, being fermionic, have the fermi-dirac distribution function\n\\[\nn_s(\\mathbf{p})=\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta E_s(\\mathbf{p})}+1},\n\\]\nwhere we allow the quasiparticle energies, and hence distributions, to differ for the two species. Since the occupancy of a given state can be zero or one only \\(n_s(\\mathbf{p})\\) is also the probability for that state to be occupied. Thus the probability of a \\((\\mathbf{p},s;-\\mathbf{p},-s)\\) state being blocked is \\(n_s(\\mathbf{p})\\left[1-n_{-s}(-\\mathbf{p})\\right]+n_{-s}(-\\mathbf{p})\\left[1-n_{s}(\\mathbf{p})\\right]\\). What if we have both a \\((\\mathbf{p},s)\\) and a \\((-\\mathbf{p},-s)\\) quasiparticle present?\n\\[\n\\alpha^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}\\alpha^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}\\lvert{\\text{BCS}}\\rangle=\\left[u^*_\\mathbf{p}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}\na^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\\downarrow}-v^*_\\mathbf{p}\\right]\\prod_{\\mathbf{p}'\\neq \\mathbf{p}} \\left[v_\\mathbf{p}a^\\dagger_{\\mathbf{p}\\uparrow}a^\\dagger_{-\\mathbf{p}\n\\downarrow}+u_\\mathbf{p}\\right]\\lvert{\\text{VAC}}\\rangle,\n\\]\nwhich is orthogonal to the BCS state. In the Anderson spin language this corresponds to reversing the direction of spin, as if\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(u,v)&=(\\cos(\\theta/2)e^{-i\\varphi/2},\\sin(\\theta/2)e^{i\\varphi/2}),\\qquad \\text{then}\\\\\n(-v^*,u^*)&=i(\\cos(\\theta'/2)e^{-i\\varphi'/2},\\sin(\\theta'/2)e^{i\\varphi'/2}),\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwith \\(\\theta' = \\pi/2 - \\theta\\) and \\(\\varphi' = \\varphi + \\pi\\).\nThe excitation energy of this state is twice the ‘magnetic field’ each pair experiences \\(2E(\\mathbf{p})\\), see Equation 10. The spin interpretation allows us to see easily that this state contributes \\(-u_\\mathbf{p}v_\\mathbf{p}\\) to the self consistent equation, and occurs with probability \\(n_{\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{p})n_{\\downarrow}(-\\mathbf{p})\\). The overall result is thus\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta&=&-\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}}\\frac{\\Delta}{2E_{\\mathbf{p}'}}(\\overbrace{[1-n_{\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{p})][1-n_\n{\\downarrow}(-\\mathbf{p})]}^{\\mathrm{no\\,qp}}-\\overbrace{n_{\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{p})n_{\\downarrow}(-\\mathbf{p})}^{\\mathrm\n{two\\, qp}})\\nonumber\\\\\n&=&-\\frac{U_0}{V}\\sum_{\\mathbf{p}}\\frac{\\Delta}{2E_{\\mathbf{p}'}}[1-n_{\\uparrow}(\\mathbf{p})-n_{\\downarrow}(-\\mathbf{p})].\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\]\nFor the case \\(E_s(\\mathbf{p})=E(\\mathbf{p})\\), and in the BCS limit where \\(\\mu\\sim E_F\\), \\(\\Delta\\ll E_F\\), this is conveniently presented in the form\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{U_0\\nu(E_F)}=-\\int_\\Delta dE \\tanh\\left(\\frac{E}{2T}\\right)\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{E^2-\\Delta^2}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu(E_F)\\) is the fermi surface density of states per spin, and we have left out the upper cut-off. This expression needs to be regularized as in the zero temperature case considered before. The resulting \\(\\Delta(T)\\) varies from \\(\\Delta(0)=\\Delta_{\\text{BCS}}\\) given by Equation 15, to zero at\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\\label{Tc}\nk_\\text{B}T_\\text{c}=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\pi}\\Delta_{\\text{BCS}},\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. This relationship between \\(T_\\text{c}\\) and \\(\\Delta_\\text{BCS}\\) is a key numerical prediction of the BCS theory. An important point is that the variation is smooth, suggesting a second order transition to a normal (non-superfluid) state above \\(T_\\text{c}\\).\nThere is a small problem. If we continue the calculation through the crossover, the temperature at which a non-zero \\(\\Delta\\) develops continues to increase indefinitely on the BEC side De Melo, Randeria, and Engelbrecht (1993)\n\\[\nk_\\text{B}T_\\text{c} \\sim E_b/2\\left[\\log E_b/E_F\\right]^{3/2}, 1/k_\\text{F} a\\gg 0\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_b=1/ma^2\\) is the binding energy of a pair. This temperature should be thought of as a dissociation temperature below which pairs can form (the logarithmic factor is entropic in origin). The temperature at which these pairs condense will however be lower, tending to the ideal bose \\(T_{\\mathrm{BEC}}\\) in the \\(1/k_\\text{F}a\\to \\infty\\) limit. A more sophisticated treatment is required to find a smooth interpolating \\(T_\\text{c}(1/k_\\text{F}a)\\).\n\n\n\n\\(T_c\\) in the mean-field theory (solid line), compared with the result of a treatment that smoothly interpolates to \\(T_{\\text{BEC}}\\) (dashed).
